Patrick Stanley: and Louis
Patrick Stanley: and All right, we're recording. So I put together pretty short agenda. just wanted to sorry that's allowing recording here. My bad.
Patrick Stanley: no.
Patrick Stanley: I forget I'm not gonna record and we have a transcript.
Rapha RSierra: I'm recording.
Patrick Stanley: Yeah, thanks. My bad, sorry about that guys. And we know okay cool.
Rapha RSierra: All good.
Patrick Stanley: I was saying I can't share my screen. if this takes more than two seconds, I'm going to and
Louis-Philippe Bellier: through all the computer
Patrick Stanley: and yeah, to make just I don't want to waste any less time, but I'm just gonna yeah.
Louis-Philippe Bellier: I have a question while you're looking for your stuff. I remember Jason saying or some people agreeing that we would start rounds of presentation that we agreed I wouldn't make sense to do that every week right, but maybe it could be and I was thinking about that. You could just do that for every month Maybe. or just a 15 minute and then if there's too many people to introduce in that meeting then it would have to jump to another meeting to introduce the people. I'm not sure if it's a great filler conversation.
Patrick Stanley: Are you talking about demos?
Louis-Philippe Bellier: no, the presentation the actual Jason somebody raised the Idea of knowing who we were dealing with in these meetings. Sometimes there were a lot more new people. And maybe it will be a good thing to you…
Patrick Stanley: Yeah.
Louis-Philippe Bellier: introduce some other people at least the new people if they don't know where they're coming from and…
Patrick Stanley: 
Louis-Philippe Bellier: then there was a thing about ly weekly. but I think monthly could be a thing, but we've never done it since It's kind of a reminder at the same time that we could be doing that every start of the month or…
Patrick Stanley: Sure.
Louis-Philippe Bellier: end of the month or whatever.
Patrick Stanley: Do you feel like we should kick off the meeting with that or do you think everyone here knows each other?
Louis-Philippe Bellier: I
Rapha RSierra: But I'll always switching to Twitter So this is Irrelevant at this point maybe I misunderstood but we want a maximum of people to join. I think
Patrick Stanley: Maybe yeah, I think it'd be nice to switch to Twitter. I think what we probably catch more people in our net. That way my guess.
Louis-Philippe Bellier: yeah, but as the working group there was also this discussion,…
Patrick Stanley: Yeah.
Louis-Philippe Bellier: but if you're saying it's relevant rather than yeah, so be it, but I just thought it would be
Rapha RSierra: No, no. No, I tense I tend to sometimes that my words are a bit aggressive I would say but yeah, I am not aware of this that just curious if that made it irrelevant then yes, just bringing that up so that people like to help the conversation.
Louis-Philippe Bellier: Yeah, some people raise it that they didn't know who were talking and who was bringing what to the table. So I think it would be a great, up X or not right Twitter or not. I think it would be great if we have speakers or if this working group is getting bigger and bigger didn't know at least, once every month. if there's new people coming in or new speakers being invited that at least they introduced themselves. it was just a reminder from the AI transcript. Giving me notification. Yeah.
Jason Schrader: Yeah. Yeah, my phone just hit trying to connect to the car here over and over again. So I had to fight it off but I thought that was something I proposed and it was basically, once a month or on just every once in a while we can do a round table and talk about anybody new or maybe real quick intros on people that are there still doing this if it does get big doing just the speakers make sense since I'm in transit today. We're kind of on a backup agenda and Patrick taking over. I probably save it for the next one which be beginning in July and then we just find those at the beginning of the month.
Rapha RSierra: That I think I loved it.
Louis-Philippe Bellier: Perfect.
Rapha RSierra: I think it allows for people to take accountability right and not just being a spectator including me so I think also Patrick your way of seeing allowing people to speak that have a demo. I think it's great.
Patrick Stanley: Absolutely. cool
Patrick Stanley: I'll leave that to a Jason usually runs these things. I'll just leave that to him to sort of pencil at the right time
00:05:00
Patrick Stanley: All right. let's thanks for that.
Patrick Stanley: so just doing the first item that by the way, feel free to add items here. I'm just doing what I thought was relevant. First item is the $2,000 Bitcoin BNS bnsx Bounty. This is the issue for I just put it in the chat. It's under agent tools. and so the prize is two thousand dollars in Bitcoin the criteria is
Patrick Stanley: Excuse me. And basically we want a tool the ability to query whether DNS.
Jason Schrader: Yeah, great clarity register and there was one more listening issue.
Patrick Stanley: query register And they can also associate the name with the associated address. And it's like what name associated with What address they're all actually just screenshots easier.
Rapha RSierra: It did you guys see my full like I did something I wasn't able to test it, but I did a pull request.
Jason Schrader: Yeah. Yeah. I left you a full review on it. And there's still some more work to be done. I think there's a little confusion and how the scripts work, but I full on outlined everything for you. So everything's
Rapha RSierra: Awesome. So is my understanding you already know how to do this. You just giving an incentive for people to sort of start working this
Jason Schrader: But I mean the other side of it too is I've got other things that I'm working on at the same time. So this is something that I'd love to go for the Bounty myself, but do I have the time for it at this moment? Not really. I hope you see it as a chance for others to be able to collaborate…
Rapha RSierra: Okay, okay.
Jason Schrader: how he's tools and…
Rapha RSierra: Absolutely.
Jason Schrader: cracks work together and it's a good test for me to make sure that Thank you there works as well.
Rapha RSierra: So just a quick question. I'll be reviewing this how far am I like? Am I really completely off I did this in an hour and a half. So using AI so it's probably wrong.
Jason Schrader: Yeah, I mean if you take a look at it, basically the tools are designed to be used for single purpose. So you have one tool that will return one value and those can be used by the AI agents and perform a tasks. So instead of adding things to the environment variables or anything else the tools should operate and do the individual things that we need that are described. So it was a step sort of in the right direction. And then the other thing that was there some files that were overwritten just files and watch.
Rapha RSierra: Yeah, that makes sense. an hour and an hour and 10 minutes, it was 11. It was very tired and AI did the job so it probably completely wrong. But yeah, yeah, I'm happy to give it a try when I find the time there's that I'm like you but yeah, I love the process and I think this is very bullish for the group to put out this bounty and give an opportunity to developers to sort of join the wagon here and the opportunities so huge that I don't really care about the Bounty and just by being in this room. I'm very grateful to be able to be here.
Patrick Stanley: All I care about getting it done. So if we need up the bounty to move it to the more.
Jason Schrader: No, I be curious if anyone from the BNS the community, I don't think we have anybody here from there on the meetings, we kind of teased it out to them and it's probably a few more contacts or other people that we could reach out to and then again if anybody has any questions on how to do the implementation or just what Rapha sent over like I did a really trying to write it up as detailed as possible because what we're all doing here is I'm not implementations working. we're making sure the system is usable by other people.
Rapha RSierra: Yeah.
Jason Schrader: So there's a lot of other factors that go into this type of thing, but I'm wondering if their eyes or maybe in another Meetup or another group just to see if there's anyone who can take a good bite out of this. Otherwise, I'm starting to think we developer mind shares, something that Stacks really needs and how many people do we have that are actually building in the DNS Community I expect there should be at least one person who could pick this up as well.
Rapha RSierra: so just one question for you Jason like to be able to test sort of the implementation so that when I push it it's not just a draft. I don't want to waste your time and thank you for getting me the feedback. I didn't even have the time to look at the feedback. But do I need to have a machine so my gaming machine to be able to test it or is it sort of easy? Okay.
00:10:00
Jason Schrader: No, no, so initially with the scripts whenever we're writing scripts for these agents. We should just be able to run the script independently. So you'll find in the first repo. They require the bun.js runtime and that's how they're currently running and the other ones work. So if you do bun run against the wallet script, it's gonna look at your environment file and it's going to tell you the active address. If you do bun run and the get AI BTC from the faucet, it's gonna send a transaction on testnet using that configured wallet to be able to do it and return you the X idx status. And if you have a DX ID, it gives you an error. So those examples are actually outlined in the feedback that I drop for you as well.
Rapha RSierra: Okay.
Rapha RSierra: Yeah, I'm glad I'm recording actually so that I can review this. But yeah, my journey is pretty overwhelming but just I agree with you this should have been done and it's maybe up the Bounty Patrick but this should be a straightforward done today. Yeah.
Patrick Stanley: Hope so. Yeah be great and kind of segue is into another topic that I have on the agenda is about personal ai's. So I wanted to create a group discussion about that get folks talking about that. and before we get into It anyone know that What is a BNS group hang where do they hang out is in Discord?
Patrick Stanley: It as if so, I'd love to just drop the bounty in there as well. just so we have an additional backup in case you're off
Jason Schrader: Yeah, that's a good idea. And I think pointing people to the pr of rapha's work. I mean, it's gonna make a little competition for you there. But there's definitely some good feedback. That's within that not necessarily Linked In the issue or we can link it there the DNS Community if I remember They did have their own Discord server. I can check on that and back at my laptop a little bit later.
Patrick Stanley: Sounds Alright, so I'll add this as a message here and
Rapha RSierra: Take your time to do that.
Patrick Stanley: Yeah. Yeah Jason ping BNS community in Discord about Bounty. Okay.
Patrick Stanley: cool
Patrick Stanley: All right, And we move to the next which is if anyone has any demos, I don't know if we necessary will on this call. But if you do we want to front load those and get Builders,
Jason Schrader: But my office I'll definitely have a demo next week.
Patrick Stanley: okay, you have a demo next week. What's your demo next week?
Jason Schrader: It's a secret. No, I think where when we're looking at this discussion. We're about to have on the personal AI stuff some of the tooling and just have some general ideas that I want to kick into place. There was some updates on The Courier AI side. They're going to be at the AI World Fair coming up here in San Francisco. I think that's actually that next week, but they have some new tooling that they've released as well as there's a new UI package that someone built around crew AI that allows you to actually spit up and save the agent housing that streamlit and web browser experience on setting up agents and tasks. And we started something similar, but I think this would be a more robust solution and needed something cooler that we can use as well.
Patrick Stanley: right cool that definitely looking forward to that if anyone else has demo wants to talk about that but now knows definitely the time.
Jason Schrader: All right just heads…
Patrick Stanley: Okay.
Jason Schrader: I'm leaving Wi-Fi. I'll be on 5G more than likely also have signal but if I drop that's why.
Patrick Stanley: All Thanks son. And super helpful, by the way on the Bounty stuff. Okay, so the kind of next thing we wanted to go through was This discussion. No.
Patrick Stanley: Okay, that's fine. And this discussion about basically. I was kind of thinking about on AI BTC dot Dev eventually, there's gonna have to be kind of like a tutorial or a demo or something people can actually engage with to get started and onboard them into our ecosystem and get them thinking about Why are we building it? who is this community? Basically, product marketing the community as well as brand marketing. So we're telling what we're building and Who We Are
00:15:00
Patrick Stanley: and for the longest time, I think just personally this is an intersection. I wanted to explore what should we build I've had so many different ideas like creating bots and, creating journalism Dows and things like ai's can do particularly. that just a regular computer couldn't do that could be cheaper than a human right? Thanks Luigi. See you.
Patrick Stanley: one thing is thinking about was what if we just made this all personal single player app. This is something like Jason and I have been working on since December. and we bought and built this. big rig like RTX 490s and we started running open source models, we set up email for our Ai and basically we're trying to build personal Jarvis and one where we own our own keys so I can instead of relying on open AI.
Patrick Stanley: Which may open AI for example, sometimes is this might violate you might ask it a question that you want to know the answer to it's like this might violate, terms or you might want to do something that it won't do and even it's not in the fairness. It's good. So basically the premise is like the people that care about having root control over their own money. Probably have a large overlap with the people who will care about having root control over their AI it's not your key is not your crypto. It's like not your API keys. Not your AI. and so I
Patrick Stanley: basically, I'm just floating this idea of it's a two-part idea kind of like one is I really need to figure out what we're gonna put on the dent on the homepage so that when people visited they can have a great experience and start building that thing and have a plan for how that takes us to the next step into is it this idea of a system personal AI a single player Ai and the way I was thinking about it and creating a personal Ai and kind of branding and as such is
Patrick Stanley: giving that characteristics like an avatar and a name and actually getting the AI to give itself these things. So you might say hey, I'd like to get started. Will you be my personal AI yes, do you have a name for me? Otherwise go ahead think of a name. My name is Jonas and I came up Jonas, Starchild I came up with that name because it was available on BNS. Would you like me to register that name? So you and everyone else interacting with me can know me by that human readable name? Yes send to Stacks to do so, but you have your wallet sent you stacks. registers its name
Patrick Stanley: This is my Associated Avatar. And you could use a Bitcoin face or something like that I have avatars and stuff that kind of look like cartoons or whatever, but you could have anything that's generated based on the name. cool. my you have my wallet. All right. where are we going to store data? And we'll store it on Fall coin or a store locally or store it on storage or what have you. And the idea is it's almost like a Tamagotchi, that you're like building from scratch and you want to improve over time.
Patrick Stanley: So ideally this personal AI can be trusted with your own private data and develops a sense of taste as a function of being close to you and being like your Sidekick, so initially it could do things like, build websites build applications reply to email, trade crypto deploy tokens, it could deploy meme coins. I get to deploy Dow governance tokens. It can work with other personal ai's because it has a heads up view of all the other personal ai's with their Associated BNS X names.
00:20:00
Patrick Stanley: So now you have this liaison that you can identify and know by its human readable name and it can also be identified, looking outward to other personal ai's. So it's not like we are interacting with each other. our proxies are interacting with each other. They can build a reputation. You can see their transactional history can see them helping each other working teams. paying for services to complete tasks and basically the idea is kind of like, start with a single-player game your personal Ai and then move to multiplayer game where you have crew Crews and AI Dows and there's people at the end of the day Behind these things but
Patrick Stanley: You're but they're deployed. they're outward facing as well as inward facing and they view your data soccer saying and they view other ai's that they trust as part of their extended team that can help them accomplish things.
Jason Schrader: Better way, if we add on to that you think of what your first experiences and you're bringing someone into facts or something else is like boom. You have an address you have a wallet now go ahead and get a BNS name and kind of make it more human readable and have an understanding of who you are and what you do like how many of us are identified by these things now, it's like when I see Rapha about BTC, I know who I'm talking to I know what kind of grounds are on so I like that ideas like the initial building block and then when it comes to the AI Dallas type operations, I mean, we've been talking to a few of the different groups including the zero off now through the boom wallet is looking at putting together shops and stores kind of similar to the resource contract idea we have and there's one more group too. That's looking my mind at the moment, but we're all looking at using the same kind of executor down structure that we've used in the past with a few minor speaks and upgrade coming from the original creator.
Jason Schrader: and so in the work that Mike's been doing with the Bitcoin now as well. He's already got some code down towards that direction. So we're thinking and building blocks and when you start with getting used to the idea of what ages can do and what they can do with wallets having a one agent for you one personalized kind of unit that you can interact with is also very useful and kind of a good way to start wrapping around. how these things can work and one more thing. I would highlight from earlier too. when we think of running these wages, you literally can run them with an open AI gp4 API key or even just three five or something similar just for initial testing the Patrick's Point too, the reason we have our own rig and the reason we're bullish on the open source models, is that at some point if I'm gonna give it access to all of my email or I'm gonna give it login to other services. I don't know trying to really want to ask that through these public apis and through these systems.
Rapha RSierra: Yeah, that's the question.
Jason Schrader: But unless you've actually dug in and…
Jason Schrader: Definitely. Yeah.
Jason Schrader: read the privacy policy in terms of service,…
Jason Schrader: Yeah, totally. …
Jason Schrader: which I'm sure we all do…
Jason Schrader: the way the agent definitions work in through AI you actually have the ability to define a Bates.
Jason Schrader: then you don't really know what's going on with that data. Whereas when you have something locally, you have a lot more freedom and possibilities for iteration and development.
Jason Schrader: That's used by all of the crews everything else. So let's say hey instead of see the G4 I want to use claw and instead of clawed. I want to use the latest BC coder or I can run a 70 DB or I can run a seven b or whatever you can point at any of those and then level deeper than that is like you can actually specify that on the agent level. So if you have a specific agent who's and expert on a certain topic that agent can be powered by a 70 local model and handle sensitive information. Whereas another agent could be powered by gp4 to do General task orchestration and develop things for the smaller agents you use so you have a lot of flexibility in how you can run these things if you have the power to run something locally.
00:25:00
Jason Schrader: The ability to do that as well as the ability to hook into several of these different engines that are online. I mean even rock with this super fast one you can use that as well. And that's in a lot of the crew AI example
Jason Schrader: Yeah, I'd say they're welcome today. And anybody who wants to Tinker with agents with wallets, we're the group to be in and we're the ones like pushing the Forefront to nothing.
Patrick Stanley: And I think the reason to register your agents his name is like yeah,…
Rapha RSierra: awesome
Patrick Stanley: Carlos dot agents We know that that is someone's Ai and that person can give Access To s day AI to its own personal data or what have you? And Carlos dot agent also has their own crypto wallet they can do business.
Patrick Stanley: and I think what's interesting about this concept is one it gives the working group something to Aspire for which is one how does this help me personally people can say hey, I just created this new feature my AI agent response to emails. And the stores all my emails locally. Okay, that's really interesting. And I have this new feature of my AI agent when it wants to complete a task.
Patrick Stanley: and it can basically post to a job board. to get a thing completed and another agents can decide to help it, whatever and
Jason Schrader: Yeah, let's say my agent earns reputation through the trajan and zero opt out.
Patrick Stanley: Right. Exactly. Yeah. Look Louis's agent already. Does that and yeah, so
Rapha RSierra: You should put the Bounty where someone needs to build the AI to solve the task itself.
Patrick Stanley: yeah. Yeah, definitely.
Jason Schrader: I think the pieces were identifying right for the reason we set up all the different GitHub repositories. The reason that we have different sections from the agent schools to the actual AI agent crew repository training data, all of that was set up so that we have individual places that drop these ideas and one of those issues or ideas could easily be turned into a bounty but one doesn't have to proceed the other it's really just about getting those ideas together and it's like, we have this idea of an AI trading box and nobody's created that yet. Nobody come in to do that. So, is it something that's really wanted or is it just an idea that we keep having because those are kind of the open questions that were going to be something out and then as we're developing things like one tool. These could be an example of another right? So as we have BNS functionality or dnsx functionality based on the Bounty that we presented you have another example of how to call a contract of how to assign a name of how to
Jason Schrader: do these different chain interactions that can easily be applied to other protocols that exist on faster.
Rapha RSierra: so, how do we go about posting these ideas and sort of selecting which one we think like Patrick that these ideas for example, the trading the training but ideas is really great. there's Arbitrage to be done cross-chain not just on stacks. And AI could handle that. even within facts
Patrick Stanley: yeah, definitely That's an easy one for Had to handle I mean even though just I think it's easy one for AI to handle it AI might even be overqualified to handle that in a way, but I think that the point I'm trying to get out here is I got a pacify the little boy but the plan trying to get out here. is that
Patrick Stanley: People are always gonna work in their own self-interest. If you're building stuff for your AI that makes your AI better and you want to share it with the community and that makes all of our ai's better and there might be a timeline when we're just improving our own personal ai's and none of them are really exposed to each other interacting with each other yet, but there will come a time when that actually does start happening. So I'm just trying to think about stages of how this working group can go instead of saying Okay, we're gonna build a Marketplace It's waybilling Marketplace for agents for that might be putting the cart before the horse really actually what you might want to do is just get good at owning your own private keys with your own agent. API keys. I gotta be back in a minutes.
00:30:00
Jason Schrader: Yeah, so to Echo that we want to start building our own useful agents. So two things that came to find one to answer your question about where to post these things. There's the AI agent crew repository and there's already some alpines for a crew there and when you go to create a new issue, it's actually going to help ethanol period of template for you to fill in and say this is what I want my crew to do this film envisioning the agent in the past the pieces that come together and then somebody else might be able to help you collaborate or think through what it is or you're at least outlining something that you want to see that's not built yet and probably, for your stuff in particularly, why not have a beachy swap tools So that an AI agent can pick up and…
Rapha RSierra: exactly
Jason Schrader: and do things so, that would exist in the agent tools TS Repository.
Rapha RSierra: That's why it's exactly what I'm asking like but I love a Patrick's approach of
Rapha RSierra: Whatever. He said right but in my case, yeah, you can't imagine an AI that is going to that you allocate some budget to that Ai, and it's able to essentially do some sort of Market making slash Arbitrage because that's a huge huge spread sometimes in some of these tokens, which is normal on currently, taxes is going to explode but currently the liquidity is we're very dry, even though we've seen what happened with zest and STX which is great. But yeah, yeah definitely something that interests me to think about and offer anyone to build I think because it makes everybody better right if this a active AI is able to capture and
Rapha RSierra: acting their own interest and capture that spread at the same time the person who wants to buy for a large amount, they're served that person and we can service whales on beefy swap essentially
Jason Schrader: So yeah another way to look at that might be like, we're all ambassadors for our own projects. Right whenever we're working on something. That's typically what we bring to the table whether it be documentation or education and other spaces or what we're trying to put together so that people use what we're building on and I'll use BP swap as an example. So you have this service, you have a few abilities that exist on there is the ability to create the swap ability to accept the swaps. There's probably a way to Monitor and read some of the functions, a lot of that I can understand conceptually, but do I know how to do it Not until I take time to use the service. So instead of just building documentation or something similar why not Teach an agent how to do and you can do that personally on your own machine. You don't have to share that with anybody but if it's useful tools and if it's something useful where an agent, you want more people running those ages.
Jason Schrader: Then that's a perfect candidate for another tool to build and bring into our ecosystem because you can imagine that somebody coming in and…
Rapha RSierra: I love it.
Jason Schrader: saying I want to use these AI agents. look I can bolt on this script and I can have an agent that's really good at doing vegan slots. There you go.
Rapha RSierra: You're almost talking about user experience here because there's such big work to do in terms of explaining why this is the solution why this is better for you instead of just talking with an AI who knows what's best sort of thing because for example, yes, there's the simple beta version currently on that was essentially built by freezer. I just tweaked a little bit but the next version that's coming is the matching on chain so match without Brokers without matchmakers and to have to explain this also the contract itself is very versatile. So I'm a bit like what just you said Patrick putting the chart before the horse. I'm almost like imposing a scheme or frame on top of it, but it's more versatile. So it could allow these agents that can speak with each other and essentially fine the best conditions for themselves.
Patrick Stanley: Yeah, exactly.
Patrick Stanley: right next Jason
00:35:00
Patrick Stanley: Hey Jason, appreciate. Godspeed Okay.
Rapha RSierra: God bless you Jason. Be safe.
Patrick Stanley: as those that was kind of basic idea and started personal AI but front load the onboarding of the crypto wallet the crypto identity the crypto vatar. that way the reality is ai's can erate They can generate a fake things. and crypto allows for scarcity and Truth. and so Let's think of you and I don't know maybe I'm wrong here. But if you front load some of the crypto things like listen, you're gonna have identity so you can use it for yourself and for others eventually, so there's a reason to want to claim this now because others will see your AI.
Patrick Stanley: you want to crypto Avatar? It's verified on chain. So you like me human readable name and then visual Avatar. You have a crypto wallet so you can send Bitcoin on an L2.
Patrick Stanley: yeah, and then you need a place to store data, so that could be locally or not. I don't know.
Rapha RSierra: Yeah if I may rephrase Patrick, it's like we've got a secured by Bitcoin now.
Patrick Stanley: Yeah.
Rapha RSierra: We want to create digital identity. Secured by our own as you said API keys.
Patrick Stanley: Yeah, digital identity secured by your crypto wallet. I guess you're API here Keys your AI Keys hold your group can hold. It's
Rapha RSierra: Yeah. Yeah, crypto. I Slash the machine. Yep.
Patrick Stanley: Yeah, Luigi Lewis talking about Arbitrage bot to fund the working group Main devs. I'm down to funded an Arbitrage bot. If you like the author of 1000 2000 dollar Bounty at that if anyone wants to run that as long as anyone can use it like anyone with AI hear two, why not nice?
Patrick Stanley: If we can run in the context of the framework that's in our GitHub using the crew the kind of UI and crew framework. And it's actually like a tool that anyone in this group can use just as easily as queering someone's name kind of thing. Yeah. I'm done. I'm down to fund development of that. Sorry, my baby keeps crying. I might have to jump off soon. If you guys if you guys want to and talk about this stuff. I'm probably the computer open and we can keep discussion going.
Patrick Stanley: Yeah, Louis, if you want to speak to Rapha, feel free over audio. I won't stop you here on mute. I'll try to be back in the next two minutes. Otherwise Consider Me Maybe gone. Sorry.
Louis-Philippe Bellier: Hey Brad.
Louis-Philippe Bellier: Might just jump out. In another meeting at the same time.
Meeting ended after 00:44:15 👋
