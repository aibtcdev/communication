Jason Schrader: All right. Hello everyone and welcome to the AI BTC Dev working group meeting. So our Bitcoin and AI sort of evaluation of what's going on at this intersection. Today is Thursday, June 13. I'm sorry 18. Wow. I pulled an old.
Jason Schrader: Old notes there, but sorry July 18th is today and I'm just gonna go over a few updates on my side of things and I'm excited because we also have some news Patrick's Day a little bit about branding. We've got some more to talk about with bounties some of the technology kind of updates and other things going on plus a little new throwing at the end. So let's go ahead and Dive Right In first website. I have up just for anybody new or just a reminder is our main homepage. We have ai BTC dot Dev, we'll see some exciting updates coming here soon, but it's definitely the main go-to place. If you need the RSVP link or just kind of a starting point to get to the documentation to get and everything else on the GitHub itself. We do have our own organization. That's where all these different repositories live that kind of give us the different sections areas and information that we work with and that's also where we track our project board. So this is what I'll be covering mainly today. So this
Jason Schrader: Is something that we can use meeting to see what's going on? Who's working on what and keep track of different issues in different buckets. So we've had this up for a while, but I went ahead and moved some things around and redid some things. So first I just wanted to say there is a PR in Flight right now. something it would pull it up here.
Jason Schrader: Let's open a new time either So this is a change that's happening. I demoed it last week where we're gonna have a UI and we're gonna be able to interact with that to create agents. I think that's gonna help make the whole process much more approachable and it is still in progress. I'm hoping to have it done by the next meeting. But while we're waiting for that one of the main things we can definitely focus on are ing the different tools that make available to the agents. So while this little bit is happening on the cruise and some of the crew items have been put just here back on the left as we're thinking through with those are gonna look like we're going to start some new bounties around the tooling. So the tooling that we need covers a few different categories, but the basic one that we're going to start with is adding tools for Native stacks.
Jason Schrader: I was gonna talk about this before and I'm putting together. This is almost like a little template we're gonna use the Bounty so still a little bit of information to fill in here, but there's all will be that when we're done. It'll look a lot like this one did for BNS support where you can see the criteria are clearly defined kind of says what it needs to do the functionality and then we'll just track who's working on it as well as participants and everything else from there.
Jason Schrader: So we're gonna fill in that information but first one up is going to be the abilities interact with Stacks. So what does that mean Native Stacks? We really just need to know the locked and unlocked balance as well as the total balance that we get from those two and then being able to transfer Stacks to a given address, very very simple operation requires some contract calls in the background but very straightforward in scoped out item and that's what we're gonna try to do with the rest of these as well. So I see one being active at a time but we're gonna throw in some of these other options here. So you have a few of the other small ones that kind of Hit the We want the same kind of tooling for Native BTC. So we're gonna want the ability to get balance and transfer also like creating inscriptions or minting and matching rooms. These are things that are available in the underlying software libraries, but we haven't made available to our agents yet. So that's where the little bouncy serial come in. We also will have one on sit 10, so you're able to see what's
Jason Schrader: The wallet and get an idea of what's owned as well as getting the balance or transferring a specific sits and token and then same for nfts on and on there's also a simple one for getting the contract source code. So, we think of our agents that are going to be working with testing structures. what Nikos is doing with the fuzzing or when we're looking at them analyzing a contractor doing anything mean even similar to what the Stacy product is doing the static analysis in any of that kind of stuff is going to require the contract code. That's always the starting point. So another very simple tool that I see and actually move this one over I think is being able to get the contract source code. And there's gonna be a few bigger ones too. So aside from these small ones. There's also going to be one for adding stats connect support.
00:05:00
Jason Schrader: And access smoking questions around this and I'm curious to say I'll pause after I explain this part just there's anybody on the call who has some input but it's been a little while since I've added multiple wallets to a website. So we're talking about stacks and Bitcoin and I'm used to using the stacks JS libraries and used to using stats connect. I haven't used SAS connect very much, but I do see some information that I'm trying to sort out and we have SAS connect which will let us do both Bitcoin and stacks methods. And then you have some tooling as well from leather. That's kind of similar and you get addresses kind of thing here. You have some of the same methods and I just wasn't sure what would be the simplest most inclusive for us to create Tools around this and…
NoCode Clarity: There's the hash Havoc team. I'm not sure if you've met them, but they would be able to attend to any sort of data that would be needed including contract code.
Jason Schrader: I'm thinking SATs connect is the answer about just pause there. I don't know if anybody has any experience with it or they've used it on a front facing app you
NoCode Clarity: So happy to make an intro very active in our ecosystem, but I know that the team and they're really solid.
Jason Schrader: Yeah, they're great team. I love them and the work they're doing I'd actually love to get teller added. it's like something that we can use as well as an agent tool. So that's a good one that I don't have on my list that I need to add. It's actually add that right now.
NoCode Clarity: Yeah, they're going through a little bit of upgrade right now. so it's gonna be a different face to teller but it's still going to be teller under the hood. So yeah,…
Jason Schrader: Okay.
NoCode Clarity: definitely a good time to chat with those guys.
Jason Schrader: Yeah, so we started the way we have our typescript repository set up. I think right now there would still be an easy API look up to where you could at least get the source code for the contract from the API so we know we're getting it from the chain but this repository we did set up because we would love to look at exposing specifically as a tool for ages to use. So there might be little bits and pieces that they need to provide you would use teller in this subcommand or some more info but we have a place for that to live and I'd love to see what happens there. So definitely if you want to reach out and just say hey this sounds interesting. I'm happy to talk with them again, too. I'd love to see what it takes to kind of get this part started because then we've got two different languages that we're working on the back end, which I think makes fun and I can see for us to come in next.
Jason Schrader: It's coming back to that. I'll add some notes here just on what I've found but we want to turn this into a bounty to just be able to add the library and add the ability to work with both native Bitcoin and Native stacks. And if the same Library can do it if it makes things straight forward as far as creating transactions and being able to call these methods and definitely open to it if there's a better way to do it or something else. This would be the place to comment if anybody has anything else, but I think we're headed in the right direction for that one.
Jason Schrader: And a few other little bouncies are gonna be in there too that we've talked about having an agent that can deploy a contract before you to play a contract, you're probably gonna be able to check and test your contract code if we create tooling that allows us to check test and deploy a contract then we can have an agent who does some very interesting things. So another set of simple kind of focused tooling that's gonna unlock more at the level of Agents.
Jason Schrader: And one more that was kind of interesting. I had this back in my notes for a while back but I'm open timestamps is a really cool concept if you haven't seen it before it's just a simple standard where you create a timestamp on bitcoin to say something existed. I love it because it is a very simple idea and I think it could easily be replicated on Stacks but as an agent doing Unchained actions, it's also an interesting way for them to attest that something happened at a point in time.
Jason Schrader: and I wanted to just leave that as kind of an open trailing idea there as well. But we have a bouncy kind of adding tooling that will allow us to create those and publish those timestamps on bitcoin. So yeah coming a little later but now you get an idea of what these different bounties can be poor especially at the tool level. And once we have the tools done and once we have more of this refactor and reorganization done on the crew level, then we can start adding bounties for creating cruise that you special things as well.
00:10:00
Jason Schrader: I see the comment time is versus time on money and it's so true. It's like, the simple proof that simple attestation can unlock a lot of cool things and even just reading through the docs you to get a sense of that, but I see it as something But when we say we want to say that we did something and we're going to publish something same with doing inscription. There's definitely some room there you could tag on to the new standard for example and create ordinal news that would automatically get published and shown somewhere. So there's some cool things that we can look into as a result, but I kind of pause there on the bounties just in case anybody has any questions
Jason Schrader: And as I mentioned before these two that are under the open Bounty category, we'll cover this category every time that we're doing the meetings so we can see kind of what's active who's working on it with the statuses are and I'll be filling in the details following this one as well as posting the notes. So we'll have some more information up on medicine.
Jason Schrader: 
Jason Schrader: So one other technical bit that I want to get into I know last week. I touched a little on Clarity as a tool so this is actually an interesting unlock for us in two ways. And I think it can help with our developer experience around our contracts. So what this does is it takes all the contracts that we have. So we look we have these three contracts right now in our repository. We're adding a fourth for adults. We're planning on all these contracts being tied together, but one of the tough things we've run into is when you're writing a UI that's gonna interact with these contracts or when you're writing any tools like we're doing for the agency interactive contracts usually have to create all the different functions that you're going to call. So when there's recent payment data. we need a way to call that so he's in a defining it and setting it up in a separate file and everybody has to do that individual. There's no way to say you can use there is ways there's not common for people to say
Jason Schrader: use what I wrote for this so we want to push claritym to be able to enable that for us. So if you look at their example here, whatever you're writing tests with claritygen or when you're writing like a front-end that's going to make contract calls. You're going to import from this Clarity and types file. And that is basically the generated types for your contracts that other applications can use and then you're going to use elements from the package to do the testing or do the contract calling or similar. So you have the one piece that would come from our repository or come from our contracts. And info is this one right here? Everything else is just a package that gets installed. So based on that we can take the contracts we have
Jason Schrader: And we can generate these types in our own smart contracts repo and we should publish that way anybody using our contracts would be able to just import this the same way. All right. I think that's it on my side. I think maybe break it up a little bit. I know you had some cool stuff. You wanted to hear Patrick.
Jason Schrader: 
Patrick Stanley: Yeah so I commissioned some designers to give us some.
Jason Schrader: They import clarity. And then boom they can set this up and get running and then we need it for the same reason that we would give this for somebody else…
Patrick Stanley: new brand treatments for ai/bdc So as you can see right now we're working with is just something Jason created…
Jason Schrader: because we need it for looking at our agent tools. For example, we can just pull up all of the correct information around the contracts without having to write the boilerplate or…
Patrick Stanley: which is cool. It's got kind of like a brain circuit thing.
Jason Schrader: do each one.
Patrick Stanley: We're gonna upgrade that to something super sexy.
Jason Schrader: So the big takeaway there is that we do want to be able to publish these I'm thinking and…
Patrick Stanley: So I'm going to show you sort of three options.
Jason Schrader: the start just as things are okay is every time the smart contracts get changed the new types get updated and…
Patrick Stanley: and that three identities that they've created and…
Jason Schrader: then anybody using it can just run an update and…
Patrick Stanley: and let's do it and
Jason Schrader: use the new functions. No questions asked there's a nice flow there that I think can happen and it's documented so we can get to it probably To stop mine.
Patrick Stanley: one thing
Jason Schrader: probably won't happen You should be able to take over. until after the cruise and
Jason Schrader: 
Patrick Stanley: Yeah.
00:15:00
Patrick Stanley: I can only see Here we go. yeah, sure screen recording on it's green.
Patrick Stanley: I just have to one second.
Jason Schrader: Is it that PDF?
Jason Schrader: but I
Patrick Stanley: What's that?
Jason Schrader: I can pull it up and share it if you shoot me the file.
Patrick Stanley: Yeah, just one sec.
Patrick Stanley: very odd
Patrick Stanley: Okay, something's going on with that. Yeah, I'll show you the file right now.
Patrick Stanley: I promise it'll be worth it.
Patrick Stanley: Alright, I just sent it to you Jason.
Jason Schrader: Heard I'm looking for that.
Jason Schrader: got to be up in just
Patrick Stanley: Thanks.
Patrick Stanley: Thanks, then folks can go full screen so you can see it. You're Gonna Want to Go pretty full screen. and see anyway All right, so you can go to next page which you can go straight into it and I'll just say when I go next. Yeah. So the design one, this is first one. I basically gave them the prompts that Because Ai and BTC haven't yet been merged the conversions hasn't happened yet. It really is in the state of a fever dream. it's like an idea. It's a prediction. It's something that we're
Patrick Stanley: everything makes logical sense AI will use money but we Builders need to create it. So because it's a fever dream at the moment. hallucination until it's reality. So we kind of had a little bit of that as inspiration for or how to go forward with a design so we went like I want that you can go next page and can we go full screen? Is it a way to go full screen or is that just sliding?
Jason Schrader: Yeah, it's technically half-screen for me. So let me see if I go full screen. How does that look to you?
Patrick Stanley: How's it look forgot for you guys?
Patrick Stanley: Can someone comment if it's too cut off as if it's too thin?
Jason Schrader: Yeah, it might be too wide, but it's full screen for me. So I've got nothing else up and you were saying the next slide.
Patrick Stanley: Yeah, let's just do that. And yes, this is the inspiration kind of like
Patrick Stanley: kind of like a hallucinatory fever dreamish even have the Tame Impala album as one of the design inspiration. So this is just inspiration mood board your next.
Patrick Stanley: So this is One option for You have the locked up just simple type logo AI bc.gov. then you have the hazy sort of version that goes well with a backgrounds there's a little weird with the black background, but when it has its treatment, it looks much better. right next line
Patrick Stanley: This is something like the artwork and a couples with the logo and the type and everything like that. And so you have kind of a digital Intelligence on the left Then you have some of the more, psychedelic futurism sort of inspired brands are treatment on the right next.
Patrick Stanley: This is the typography for this brand. And go Just clean easy read the color scheme is holographic and black and white. Go next. Here's an example of what it would look like if we had an what the event advertising would look like go next. This idea of Socials. So you have a little pfp with the bdc.dev with the humanoid digital intelligence figure in the background. your next
00:20:00
Patrick Stanley: it's kind of like an example of the website. go and some swag next
Jason Schrader: I love this way.
Patrick Stanley: Yeah, some lanyards and stuff and next. And then kind of like what it looked like if we were at a conference, so we're at a 500 person conference people going up on stage background and…
Jason Schrader: s
Patrick Stanley: everything like that. Okay next. I said directions to the Direction one. I think is very good direction to is less of a psychedelic sort of thing and More just futuristic focus on the fusion of the AI in Bitcoin in a kind of abstract, but abstract way. And go next.
Patrick Stanley: So here's design inspiration. So you have things like the movie X Machina and just some different type treatment and we still kept that kind of wave pattern with the lines like you saw from that Tame Impala album, but it's a little more serious. It's less less hazy kind of stone or hallucination and More AI aesthetic right go next.
Patrick Stanley: Here's the logo very futuristic sexy and elongated. Is next. We have a good Cadence Jason you kind of got to just This is the artwork. So this would be like some of the treatment that you'd see on the website on social at events the orange represents Bitcoin and the blue represents Ai and you have this kind of conversion sort of happening where they're kind of coming together. You have bolds to it a brain and in a way but still keeping with that sort of fever dream hallucination- kind of motif All right next.
Patrick Stanley: So here's some of the more artwork. So we are introducing the digital intelligence. this would represent your agent pfp on the left. You see it has the orange, it's kind of a state of motion there could be, talking and it's using energy to talk so the vibrations and the frequencies are altered there. All right next.
Patrick Stanley: And here's the color palette. So you have the art Look Bitcoin on electric view blue representing AI you have the gradient representing the fusion you have black white gray and…
Jason Schrader: I got there it is on the body texture.
Patrick Stanley: kind of for the more like, serious sort of static the more sexy kind of said I type faces Rock grotesque, which on it's very like ex machina kind of sexy future sort of thing.
Patrick Stanley: Yeah, Very easy to read. All right So here you can see some of the treatment you'd see for a summit if we had an AI BTC Summit.
Patrick Stanley: Go next. This is what social would look like. you see the P. Thank you Louis. You see the notes you see the pfp avatar? There so when you see that in the feed shows up, it's almost like that Avatar is talking when it says a tweet, that's kind of the implied thing there and It's an intelligence. there has its own profile and…
Jason Schrader: I think that he's trying to do the sliding panels,…
Patrick Stanley: it represents AI btc.dev.
Jason Schrader: where it's almost like you flick it up and…
Patrick Stanley: Thank you. Is what here's kind of like a gist of…
Jason Schrader: you go to the next panel so like that.
Patrick Stanley: what the website could look like you would have our sections and some explainer, but basically just showing it on a computer with the treatment. next
00:25:00
Jason Schrader: Sure.
Patrick Stanley: Yeah, and also I think we can make an animations.
NoCode Clarity: so If I can quickly interject,…
Patrick Stanley: It's kind of like blowing and moving the gradient are not the great and…
NoCode Clarity: because I have to run to a meeting pretty soon. I love everything about the second Direction,…
Patrick Stanley: this time. All right next.
NoCode Clarity: but I love the font of the first Direction.
Patrick Stanley: And you can just kind of toggle through these you can see the hat in the event ticket and something like that. the lanyard in the booklet
Patrick Stanley: Of course.
Patrick Stanley: Mm- Yeah, I found to the first Direction. there's a bit of a antisocial Social Club Vibe with the kind of waviness and it's something to consider. because it sticks with the sort of fever dream sort of aesthetic It's a bit hazy. It's a bit kind of Stoner hazy. you want to scroll up briefly Jason we can do that and then because and Chris. I wish you didn't have to jump because there's some really interesting things coming up in this deck.
Patrick Stanley: Yeah.
Patrick Stanley: That's good feedback. Thank you. All right, so we'll try to get through some more just in case you can catch the rest here. So directing to Alternative this basically Direction three. So this would be the typeface still a little more ex machina, but you can imagine seeing a movie. It's about Ai and this is that the typeface. So here I really love this sort of treatment on the types. We take the typeface from the logo.
Patrick Stanley: And we kind of have this sort of interpolated. I don't know how to describe it but it connects the ladder is obviously it just kind of like it's got motion to it. I think it looks sweet. So this is something that if we wanted to use the second Direction and have this as an alternative design to go with the second direction that could fit pretty easily if we wanted to do that. We could make that happen. All right, let's keep going Jason. Right again, we have the pfp. The look, the guy then, a little bit of the treatment here is on the right is kind of more toned down serious. All right, let's keep going.
Patrick Stanley: You can see the color palette with you for a second. we kind of went through some of our compound the last. Again, Rock to protest for the font and rocker test. Why here's what it looked like we had an AI BTC Devcon It looks cool. I had attend that then this is the social media.
Patrick Stanley: So the letters are a little more strewn than my liking there would be nice of his little more legible like we saw. Above but it's kind of the just all right, let's keep going down. See if there's anything I'm not sure if there is. this website. And imagine landing page in the left and then sorry.
Patrick Stanley: Yeah, me too. It's super sexy. You can imagine landing page in the left and if you scroll down maybe it's like, meet your AI agent or something like that and just kind of like getting started with your AI agent to that effect. That's keep going. We're wrapping up soon. These are just some events wag. You see the Hat. And everything lanyard, notebook. This would look like we're at a conference…
NoCode Clarity: two strongest to a strongest to me.
00:30:00
Patrick Stanley: if 500 people and kind of like what the background kind of would look in that just top sample copy not real. This is all the treatment side by side so you can get sense.
Patrick Stanley: Me too. and I had the designers take an extra turn on to
Patrick Stanley: Direction one just felt too much just for me. I don't want to install too much thought into you guys have mines. But Direction one just felt a little bit too Stoner aesthetic. Direction two and three are very serious which has a lot of weight to it. And it's less Whimsical Less Fun more serious, and I just like Direction two was a combination of a little bit of fun but also very serious and we can also borrow some of the treatment from direction to like that that kind of like snake a snaking sort of connection of the letters. We can actually steal that and apply it to with direction to type logo font. Okay, it seems like everyone likes Direction too, which I'm very very happy about that because I personally like that as well.
Patrick Stanley: and the agency that together these designs they've done design work for some of the top. hotels in the world
Patrick Stanley: and These are members from the agency operating on their own. So they don't have a name but they're out there to see and I can tell you later when it's not transribed. Who yeah, but yeah, they're talking agency out of New York City and
Patrick Stanley: Yeah, I think they did a great job it's a big upgrade? All right, I'll stop there but love to hear folks comments what they think if they like it.
Patrick Stanley: J P2 thumbs up cool
Patrick Stanley: great. Don't it does have wait.
Patrick Stanley: Thank you.
Jason Schrader: yeah.
Patrick Stanley: Thank you.
Jason Schrader: switches back
Patrick Stanley: That's it. I'm seems well received…
NoCode Clarity: It was good man.
Patrick Stanley: if anyone else wants to comment feel free.
NoCode Clarity: Thanks for sharing.
Patrick Stanley: Otherwise, we can dip back into some of the more Dev work stuff.
NoCode Clarity: Jet I did make that group with them Havoc tell her team. so can hopefully get them on a working group call and potentially get them Bounty for Integrations,…
Patrick Stanley: Thanks for your patience. I know it was a long Prezi,…
NoCode Clarity: whatever but loving the progress of everything.
Patrick Stanley: but fun one.
Jason Schrader: Yeah. Yeah. I just want to actually give them a shout out to one of the guys from their team is the one who completed our BNS County. So I'm sure we'll have plenty to talk about I'll let him know that bounties are coming up to.
Patrick Stanley: Thank you. I got that dog in them.
Jason Schrader: so I heard
Jason Schrader: all right getting back to main screen here. So this will end up looking a lot prettier. That's nice.
Jason Schrader: Can't wait to see how that turns out. But already what we were talking about too. The idea like panels being able to Snap and scroll would be pretty and…
Patrick Stanley: which
Jason Schrader: the idea especially that third one being able to drag and move the letters elements just sounds like fun. Okay, sit there and play with it for a minute. Yeah, cool on the development side basically covered everything there on the project board that we have before the new bounties will be coming online shortly.
Patrick Stanley: yeah.
Jason Schrader: We'll see an announcement definitely watch The X account for that and then we'll be updating support info just cross these repos. But this is the main place to go the website again have the project board and we'll talk about that in each of the meetings moving forward. There were a few little things, we would share AI news at the beginning in the old ones and I did grab a few things that I thought were interesting and wanted to share back. So you just a sec? Yeah.
00:35:00
Jason Schrader: on my screens in the right place
Jason Schrader: All right, one and I'll go and share things as we go. So one. Is this system prompt for Claude sonnet. So if you've been using clouds on it, it is a cheap and effective way to really get some things done. I'm loving how it's working out on the tasks that I'm doing the Claude artifact interface, which there has been one that's been open source as well. It's very useful. And then this is just a nice long basically prompt for creating a model anytime to see these that are really successful and they get really popular. It's fun to just kind of pull them out and see what we can learn from it with our own prompting techniques. And let's see the question in the chat is it almost as powerful as far? and I would say yeah, I tend to default to using it right now and I like the artifacts thing because you can sit there and make revisions you can say, okay now we get that let's do this or you can the claw.
Jason Schrader: Also lets you create projects where you can upload a bunch of files and you can reference them as you're working at the same time. So there's some neat abilities kind of baked in there that make it a little more effective. I'd say it's still struggles. Kind of the same as foro where depending on what you prompted. You don't always get the same thing or you still do get a fill in the blank or complete this later type comments in some of the codes sometimes or the thing. I've noticed that It'll remove things that I've done intentionally in my code that I might not catch right away. a recent example was I had an FAQ list on a website. I was just trying to make some small modifications to how it was laid out and everything else and it removed my invisible border change because I didn't like the ugly Border Lines that are there.
Jason Schrader: If I hadn't looked and noticed it would have been a regression in production just because I asked the Allen to create some code. So those are the little challenges that I think we run into in the background. But either way really cool to see a cool prompt here. Another one I wanted to share is this one which is Coastal Mamba by Mistral has come up. So this girl has made some excellent models. We love a lot of the work you're doing Coastal is kind of their code focused one, which you can use with cursor Ai and some of the newer GPT extensions.
Jason Schrader: And then one more I thought was interesting. we've talked a lot about bringing your own model and being able to do that and great browser is one where I'm actually really surprised at how well this has been working for me. So anybody who's using Brave browser has probably used great search before and in my personal experience. It was like it never really worked. I would search for something and All right. I'll just go back to Google and I'll search again and I'll find what I'm looking for totally different set of results different situation ever since they added Leo, which is their browser AI that I've been using for searches actually really impressed because if you do something like a search for a recipe or a search for something specific a certain topic it'll return that result as an AI generator result based on the different things that it looked at. So it works really well and they just published that they're going to allow people to use their own models as well. And what I loved about it was a recommended
Jason Schrader: Look as the way to run it. So basically you can Brave the Leo product to any local model that's hosted on your machine with a compatible API. And that's pretty huge because that means it's just another way that you can use local AI without having to worry about getting caught up in sharing your data everywhere and other situations and bring this a browser. There's so much possible at this level, there's been a lot of talk about how to use browsers and extensions. It's an extension to technically have access to all websites that you're accessing so browser and extension level access is kind of in from that perspective.
Jason Schrader: And another update that came from very recently I thought was interesting is they added Bitcoin wallet support to their in wallet. So not one that I've tested personally. I don't have a stand for approval or anything like that. But just love the fact that you can now create and use Bitcoin as easy as setting up a great browser and it's just another option that people will have out there. So I'll show the links to both of those back here in the chat. That was pretty much what I wanted to cover today. I don't know if anybody else has any other AI news and the announcements or anything kind of along the lines of our intersection that they'd like to share pause there.

Luigi Ottoboni: One it is from yes code and the other one from charging people.
Jason Schrader: Yeah, they got me thinking that definitely Sharon in the chat and all start compiling these alongside some of the training data that whole repository we're putting together. We can make a section for prompts and just keep some of these all in one place because I think there's so much we can learn from how the big system prompts are working and ever since the first chat GPT ones were leaked. I've always kind of had a side interest in that.
Luigi Ottoboni: Yeah, I'm gonna and share it in the chapter. I don't know if Google hello to share fine. But otherwise, I will send you the score
Jason Schrader: Yeah, that's good. You send them to be a Discord. I'll get them linked up in the right places.

Jason Schrader: Yeah. Yeah, the goal is gonna be like we're trying to section out into simple pieces. And I think we've got that pretty well identified. So I'll be excited to get those moving. And then of course the new branding so we get to see some fanciness come in. That'll show up in a few different places.
Patrick Stanley: Yeah, we'll have the live files for Branding to apply them by tomorrow. Just so Jason.
Jason Schrader: Yeah, when we're ready to we can publish them in the same place that we have the resources for meetings and that kind of stuff to so there's music. And we'll be ready whenever we're ready. We can start knocking out those tasks. So those are the biggest ones next week gonna look forward to showing up a little more about what we're doing with the cruise and the user interface in order to create them and hopefully just keep that Bounty engine movement and get some more of these tools set up so we can keep creating new things.
