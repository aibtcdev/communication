Louis-Philippe Bellier: Hi everyone, this is an automated message to let you know my Tactiq extension: https://tactiq.io/r/transcribing is transcribing this meeting for me so I can give my full attention to you.

00:17:21.667,00:17:24.667
Louis-Philippe Bellier: the post I shared last meeting about how The Graph has fully jumped into the AI bandwagon, not sure if you had time to check, but here it is again: https://x.com/PinaxNetwork/status/1818997083099087009

00:17:29.259,00:17:32.259
Louis-Philippe Bellier: through Semiotic Labs

00:17:53.835,00:17:56.835
Louis-Philippe Bellier: The AI/LLM to SQL to blockchain platform I shared a demo of.

00:21:31.269,00:21:34.269
Jason Schrader: yes! I need some time to learn more and figure out where it fits in the tooling.

00:22:00.751,00:22:03.751
Louis-Philippe Bellier: might, might not, let me know if you wanna see a demo again

00:23:17.777,00:23:20.777
Louis-Philippe Bellier: IMO: the wallet is the agent's, the agent is not yours, the swap isn't yours ultimately

00:23:38.466,00:23:41.466
Louis-Philippe Bellier: debatable I guess

00:23:40.443,00:23:43.443
Jason Schrader: if it's running with your API keys though... idk definite gray area

00:24:10.520,00:24:13.520
Louis-Philippe Bellier: until swaps aren't considered taxable events

00:25:13.434,00:25:16.434
Jason Schrader: AIBTC dev package ;)

00:31:36.437,00:31:39.437

Dan Edlebeck: totally different fontier for our spieces

00:32:56.636,00:32:59.636

Louis-Philippe Bellier: my dream

00:34:11.876,00:34:14.876
Louis-Philippe Bellier: I don,t want to do swaps, I want my AI to pick-up on all things I do at work, all notes and automtically pick-up on the insider info and make profitable trades.

00:34:14.355,00:34:17.355
Louis-Philippe Bellier: my POV

00:35:05.803,00:35:08.803
Louis-Philippe Bellier: Gov's take: AI agents getting audited by SEC

00:35:06.757,00:35:09.757
Jason Schrader: That's where I see crews being powerful, define your employees (agents), their tasks (project scope), and their operating rules (style guide, past results, etc). Run them when needed or on a schedule and review the results.

00:35:18.477,00:35:21.477
Louis-Philippe Bellier: Claude

00:35:46.022,00:35:49.022

Louis-Philippe Bellier: metaverses

00:37:01.248,00:37:04.248
Louis-Philippe Bellier: WOuld love to see this WG build the cheapest LLMs running agents that makes even the smallest swap profitable.

00:37:18.327,00:37:21.327
Louis-Philippe Bellier: this now makes it an actual product at scale.

00:37:59.263,00:38:02.263
Louis-Philippe Bellier: 0.001$ x 100M is still equals 100k

00:38:17.661,00:38:20.661
Rapha RSierra: are you talking about arbitrages Louis?

00:38:36.758,00:38:39.758
Rapha RSierra: cross chains

00:39:06.163,00:39:09.163
Louis-Philippe Bellier: arbitrage is easy, just saying this could be an alpha as it's so easy and everybody does it. What I'm saying is any swaps. 0.001$ x 100M tx still = 100k$

00:39:20.416,00:39:23.416
Rapha RSierra: gotcha

00:40:23.709,00:40:26.709
