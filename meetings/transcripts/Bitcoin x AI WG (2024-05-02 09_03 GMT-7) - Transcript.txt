Jason Schrader: There we go. So welcome everybody to the Bitcoin and AI working group. Today is Thursday May 2nd and can't believe we're already in May, we started back in February and time is flying by but sort of the updates announcements and a lot of the fun stuff. We're getting done. So really quick just to tidy up some of the working group items as far as our main page and our GitHub. a few things have been updated. So one the meeting minutes were pending for quite a while. I got kind of locked up. I'm getting So those are out now, so you'll now see that we have minutes for April 18th And then April 25th. I'm just covering the agenda and the different topics there. So those are up and they'll be up on a better Cadence following this and there's also some links here as promised for this solidity Clarity stuff that we talked about too as far as being able to compile or work between the two ecosystems.
Jason Schrader: And I started thinking I was taking meeting notes and I was like, all right. I need to be using AI more. I mean that's what we talked about quite often. So you went ahead and used Claude Opus just because that's what I had available to summarize all the meetings and want to get this over to AI agents some really fun use case. So The publishing will happen a lot faster. I've got two engineering projects that are kind of taking my focus but not very much longer and then I'll have much more time to contribute as well. Which really looking forward to And then one other thing for the working group that I wanted to share is we had a Meetup which we pixel link here real quick.
Jason Schrader: There was a crew AI Meetup in San Francisco.
Jason Schrader: And was first one that they've thrown we had a bunch of people out there and I was able to get up and talk about our working group in a little bit of what we're doing. So hopefully we'll get some new attendees today and we're just kind of spreading the word and letting everybody know about what's going on and I will share the slides to the PDF as well. When I post the meeting notes that way everybody can kind of see what we went over. You can see one of them in the background here, but just going over our thesis like why this intersection is so important and some of the work we've done today and it seemed very well received. So I think anybody that we're showing these ideas to there's so many things to think about between Ai and the Bitcoin kind of crypto world that it's hard to have mind share for everything. So even just us meeting and putting together these news items and making progress every two weeks or every week is very powerful. Cool, anyone else on the way in I see a thumbs up from a few. I like it. We'll start with that and if we want to change it we can change it later.
Jason Schrader: 
Jason Schrader: All right. on to the fun part,…
Jason Schrader: So I want to keep that up and
Jason Schrader: there are so many things going on in the AI world.
Jason Schrader: really appreciate showing up and doing everything they do.
Jason Schrader: I feel like I take these notes constantly And…
Jason Schrader: 
Jason Schrader: I really want to feed them into a crew. We'll get that back to that part later, but lots and lots of stuff going on. Mostly around first thing I wanted to cover is a ton of new model releases. So, the new foundational models for Lama 3D and llama 70b dropped you had the mixtural 8 by 22 be right before that and that means all of the fine tunes kick off and we're waiting to see some of the different options and things that are happening. And of course, it's a new meeting. So we have a new crew AI release they just cut a release candidate that I don't have a link to at the moment. But that'll be the next thing we can test out make sure things are still working. And last thing on the working group updates, so, we did a nice round table. I think it was two weeks ago just to kind of see who's on the call tell a little bit about your background why you're interested where you think you can contribute those kind of things. I like doing that. Obviously, we're not gonna want to do it every meeting because it's gonna take up a big chunk of time. But I was curious what everyone thought should we do something like that once a month or once a quarter? what would be a good Cadence for just hearing who's on the call and maybe introducing some of the new people? So some of the ones I wanted to share is there's a version of this pop in the right window here. There we go version of Lama 3 8B. So a smaller model with a 1 million token context window.
00:05:00
Jason Schrader: And this is really interesting because as a base model, that means a lot of other things are going to open up with this context window and we're seeing needle and Haystack type tests and there's a lot of advantages to having that larger context window and there's a little bit of a trade off with compute. That was one I wanted to share there is a new foundational model from Quinn. So you have the Clinton 1.5 110 B big giant model for anyone who's got the compute and resources to run it and some quantize versions as well. There is a new Hermes 2 Pro based on llama 3B that just came out and won't let me click the link. There we go.
Jason Schrader: Gonna get it to focus on this window here. So Hermes 2 has been excellent for function calling tool use agents. It was one of the favorite ones and we actually see a comment right here from Joey saying, boy, here's another one to try and I'm excited to see what it can do. So, shout out to house for bringing this one up and they're actually gonna be coming out with a 70D version as well. That's still in its training.
Jason Schrader: And then another set so this is one group hermese news research. Very good to keep track of they do some Fine tunes. Another one is Eric Hartford over at cognitive computations. So I got the link to the actual hugging face right here because there's so many different models that they work on but they apply a specific data set. They remove some of the alignment issues. I just really like everything I've seen from this individual and a lot of the work they're doing so they have dolphin 2.9 is the latest version, but they have versions for the Llama 370b the Lama 38b with the 1 million context window. And then dolphin 2.9 for mixed rule 8 by 22b as well. So whenever a new foundational model comes out if you want to try a little fine tune or a little change on top they seem to be the fastest in dropping these out. That's another good one to have bookmarked.
Jason Schrader: Let's keep moving. Another one that I wanted to share more agents is all you need. This is a Very interesting paper just to sum it up basically if you're using multiple LM agents and the way you have them converse with each other you end up with a better outcome, if we simplify that it's pretty simple. It's like you have a two-phase process where you're feeding your task or your query into the agents. You have the agents generate different answers. And then finally there were two new lava releases. So if you haven't heard of lava, these are multimodal models that are built on open source software. very interesting what you can do with them. You can do images you can do video you can do a lot more I think audio as So really cool to look into those and again, based on the base models that have come out the two big ones are the lava based on llama three eight feet and there's a one based on five three mini. So if you haven't seen that that's a Microsoft small little model that they put out as well as a base model. Cool, so that covers just the Roundup on releases, just pause there and see is anybody seen any other really cool models out there. You have the agents use majority voting to determine the violence final answer. So putting those techniques together is something we can definitely do with crew AI just because of the way it's built so you can change out the models that you're using both at the crew level and at the agent level so you could possibly have answers from multiple models and then a vote that determine which one is best.
Jason Schrader: 
Jason Schrader: 
Jason Schrader: And the paper itself gets a little more into detail on…
Jason Schrader: Is there anything anyone's excited about on that part?
Jason Schrader: how they're actually using Chain of Thought and…
Jason Schrader: everything else. And of course all these links will be shared back in the leading notes consuming Cool, so that was one that I thought was really applicable to crew and what we're doing and another one kind of we touched on some of these points, but I'll share the link to it as well. That idea of the very large context wind being really helpful for the llm performance in general. So, you can do one of the cool things you can do with such a large context window is you can give a lot of examples so you get that many shot learning approach where it's like, okay, this is three good examples of what I want. This is three bad examples of what I want Don't do that. We get a lot more room to enter that type of information but as I mentioned earlier compute scales pretty heavily when you're increasing the context window size, so I'm curious to see this one mil context size.
Jason Schrader: How well it runs on a machine even like the big rig we have here. So hopefully I have a little bit of report back on that next meeting. And just a few more and still Amaze it all the different things going on. All right. So this one was really cool. This is a model of visualization that didn't work the way I expected it. But yeah, this is a model visualization video that I will share back after.
00:10:00
Jason Schrader: And it kind of shows the growth of the different models over time and it gives you a good visual of how open source is competing with proprietary elements. As we're looking at the data across those so I thought it was a really cool thing to see we don't sit here and watch the whole video now, but I'll definitely share that back and it shows not only that open source is closing the Gap, but also that big tech companies are sort of taking over some of the foundational model roles. You'd expect they have the biggest resources. They have the biggest compute. So, that would naturally kind of fall into their Arena cool next up. There was an interesting set of models. I've never heard of before so these are called sailor models. And there's code on they have a little web page here. But what I like about what they did here.
Jason Schrader: Is they open source the entire data toolkit for training? So you have another end-to-end processing pipeline for M training that's available. And the more of these that come online the better, I think there's been a lot of Tool Work recently both in creating training data, which is something we definitely want to explore for our nuances as well as how to get it into something that's really useful. you don't want the duplication you want to make sure data is nice and clean because that is really key at the end of the day whenever you're training a model or even doing fine tuning it's all about the data. And on the subject of fine-tuning now, this is something we've covered before but I got to kind of confirmations before it.
Jason Schrader: Is the issue of when you go to fine-tune a model and it doesn't work as well as you think so, there's some cases where doing too much fine-tuning or depending on the data that you've used. It will actually do a whole bunch of forgetting. It will only return your data. These are some of the points I know Luigi shared before and just saw a big write-up on it. So I thought that was cool thing to share. And there's a follow-up post to that that also says when fine-tuning is useful. So this is a good kind of opinion piece on why we want to do that what's going on there? And finally last one that I had on my list is this paper here. So Carlos Perez, if you haven't followed him, he writes up some really long form great stuff on LMS and was looking at this one here where we've covered this idea. But basically if you're using a bunch of specialized smaller models,
Jason Schrader: You can get better performance than trying to use one big brain so that we're seeing that theory kind of play out.
Luigi Ottoboni: Yeah. I can share one. Let me grab This one it is a Shah.
Jason Schrader: And of course, I think that's where all of the Innovation is going to be as well. As you know, we can do and move so much faster with small models and…
Luigi Ottoboni: Let me get it.
Jason Schrader: then those things that we learned will move up to Big moments.
Luigi Ottoboni: okay one it is arriving here this one it is pretty interesting because
Luigi Ottoboni: He sees that the approach of the quantization it is ending. I don't know if you are familiar guys with the quantization, but it is a way to reduce the size of the modeler practically reducing the size of the floats use in the morning the way it's and it seems that when I'm at Lama 3 is more than La mucho, I mean the size of the model it is more or less the same because I'm not sure was a seven billion and I'm afraid he's just a billion but the size is more or less the same but it seems turning that we are a couple of magnitude more so they squeeze more that inside the modern free and what it happened squeezing more that inside mother that I'm a free is that
00:15:00
Luigi Ottoboni: when you started to quantity quantize the model he seems that you're reducing the quality of the model and this is the comments pointing to the density of the information that are so inside the model. It seems that we have at least two three or the magnitude of that that we can squeeze more inside the modern but at some point probably what we will not be able to quantize the model. So this technique probably it is closer to the end or it will be limited to some more scenario and not today.
Luigi Ottoboni: Another link is that it is interesting, but probably heard about let me copy the message it is. In the wild this one said today but two.
Luigi Ottoboni: Broken dried link the window. There is a model that is coming. Probably from a chat from open AI that is called charge gbt2 that is very strange. And this moderate is his better than charity for and who tested the says that is smarter than charity following many fields and it seems that is also very fast and there is more so it seems that opening AI if this model has been released by opening AI found a way to have more modern that is better than the peak.
Luigi Ottoboni: Charged bt4. So it is interesting. There are a lot of speculation. If you search about this, there are a lot of people speculation around this model as you can see this news that is a 1.5 billion parameters model and it is incredible that is a smarter than the charity for that nobody knows but it could be grander billion or one trillion of parameters before so it seems that they found that way but a small model Excuse me. There's more modded. There is very smart.
Luigi Ottoboni: And bulai also to mention what Jason really said about the contexter. It is very interesting this news because it means that now having a very big context it is competitive with the fine tuning. So in some scenario, it is better to have a probably holding formation or the instruction in that in the context instead of trying to find tuna model because mother as the problem that it is very risky. I mean you can spend a lot of time. Thank You want what you can get it is a model that is not working correctly. So maybe that is better to instruct the model we did with a big account. And another thing that is emerging.
Luigi Ottoboni: Excuse me. that is pretty clear that every day. There is a new model. If you have it to tune all the models that are coming out. You cannot understand all the result that you can get if you wanted to be a quickie quickly is richer if I know that probably it is better to pay more and using a user context obviously everything depends from the use case,…
00:20:00
Jason Schrader: That's great. Thank you for those and just the recap on those, you…
Luigi Ottoboni: but it is something to think about to use the context instead of the thank you and…
Jason Schrader: the end of quantization I think is really interesting because originally it was like you could run a larger model quantize and get a better performance.
Luigi Ottoboni: interesting thought that the popularity Shah with you Jason is that
Jason Schrader: So we're seeing that shift as these smaller models are becoming a lot stronger the GPT to model. I have another post that I'll share along with that some speculation around where it came from and everything else and The Benchmark idea. I love this. So, the more cruise we have the more we can test. And I know crew AI internally runs something like two or three hundred Crews whenever they do a release just to make sure things are kicking off correctly. So maybe there's some room there where we can either have our own or we can link up with some of the work that they've done so we can actually do our own evaluations because I think real world evaluations are the best
Jason Schrader: I mean l insisted a great job with a versus B. And I think that's a good way to just get a reading but actually completing the tasks and using tools and like we're adding on a lot of layers as we're trying to use something like create AI knowing which models work best really helps with being able to direct people…
Luigi Ottoboni: It is at this point…
Jason Schrader: who might want to try this out or…
Luigi Ottoboni: since that there are models that are released every day.
Jason Schrader: use it so definitely on board with that and it's a great lead in kind…
Luigi Ottoboni: It would be nice to have a kind of a benchmark to understand very quickly.
Jason Schrader: what I want to talk about one of the things I love that we're doing is working in public. we meet up every week we talk about the things we've done and…
Luigi Ottoboni: If you can adapt the model you can switch the model to a new one that is Mark there or…
Jason Schrader: I think up until now it's been kind of hard to organize the different tasks for different lanes that we've been thinking in and…
Luigi Ottoboni: cheaper or have a sound in that that is better…
Jason Schrader: I wanted to help out with that. So in our main GitHub repository,…
Luigi Ottoboni: because the question is like I like it before there is a new model we have it required.
Jason Schrader: I started creating different issues based on things we've talked about in the meeting. And these can become Central discussion points for the different things we want to do.
Luigi Ottoboni: But how can you try and you say okay, we can switch to a new model you need a set of Benchmark of the request size very vertical on your use case to say,…
Jason Schrader: So if there's one particular thing that interests you this would be the best place to look.
Jason Schrader: And then obviously any of them are for discussion in the Discord or anywhere else so happy to help with those. So some of the ideas we talked about before were meme coin trading and…
Luigi Ottoboni: yes, we can switch and…
Jason Schrader: I want to create an actual issue template.
Luigi Ottoboni: we can keep the same quality software of the aging That we developed.
Jason Schrader: So I want to create a crew. Here's the information. I need to get it done. I think that'll play in nicely too for ise making cruise. We talked about deploying the smart contract.
Luigi Ottoboni: So in my opinion it is starting to become very important to use the context and…
Jason Schrader: We've also had an interesting subject come up on Smart contract analysis and…
Luigi Ottoboni: the benchmarket to understand when it is possible to switch.
Jason Schrader: doing fuzzing. So for those not familiar fuzzing is a type of test. Where you
Luigi Ottoboni: These are my talks about the AI.
Jason Schrader: Look at all the possible things that you can input into a function and you send a whole bunch of different values instead of just one. So it's like an expanded way to test it. You can do the the biggest value and negative value all the different things that would help make sure that the software operates as you expect and having a crew for that sounded like a really really good match because you can't always answer all those questions just through the script. I see Chris here is your hand. Go ahead.
Jason Schrader: Three two one. Okay, last one was handling the meeting tasks. So, I posted here. This is kind of what I do after each meeting and there's definitely some room to automate this. I think there's a ton we can do here and I'd love to explore agents kind of doing that as I mentioned earlier the meeting notes. I did this last time I went ahead and just use clock because it was right there, but this was a nice way to dog food our product and also say sometime. Cool. That's how you raise your hand again, please go.
NoCode Clarity: Yes, sorry. I think Google meets rugged me. But there was a person at the Harvard hackathon that myself Adam Kenny Ryan Eric from hero. We were at in judging and mentoring one of the winning teams actually is a solo founder who got funding. For his fuzzer idea and I'm talking to him in reference to Clarity and he was saying that it's interesting because all of the other smart contract languages need something like this, but for clarity it's built in a way where it's almost bulletproof as is but he's open to building something that would integrate Clarity. So, if you're interested I can reach out to him and see if he's willing to talk and present very sharp young guy and I think you guys would like what he has to say and he's open again to integrating clarity.
Jason Schrader: Yeah, that would be amazing to see and I see a Nikos has his hand up as well. he's the one who taught me all about fuzzing. So I definitely want to hear your thoughts on that.
Nikos Baxevanis: All Yeah, that sounds great. And Rod is also in the call. We were part of the team that fast the pox4 contract. We wrote the building house. We wrote Our Father for doing fuzzing and Clarity. So absolutely we would like to hear more about
00:25:00
Nikos Baxevanis: What? this guy came up with so, it claims ideas and
Nikos Baxevanis: very interested
NoCode Clarity: So yeah, I'll be sure to reach out to him. so yeah, that's cool. I'll keep you guys in Loop and see when we can get him into the meeting so he can chat. He is based in London. So for time reasons, I'll try and find a day that works best for him. Even if it's not next week or the week after but we will get him here.
Jason Schrader: We have the one issue. So kind of go back to it here open around that idea of smart contract analysis and fuzzing. So if there's an easy way to work async at least leading up to the meetings or just to get everybody in touch with each other. This is definitely the place so I have at the Mosaic here. That would be Nikos who just spoke on the call. And would love to I think one thing I love about this community is how collaboratively all are. So whenever I hear things like that like, you're working on with this person's working on. Let's look at you guys up and see what happens.
Jason Schrader: All right, so I went through some of the issues here. So, the AI agent crew it's gonna be mostly each one of these can have issues focused on the different things that we're building. So we go into smart contracts the kind of open tasks. We talked about the playing on mainnet and to be able to do that. We need at least one good example resource and I have one in mind that's something that I'm working toward but if anybody else has some simple examples other resource that they could provide today, that would be super useful. We can kick this off with some very small amounts and just get things testing and then also looking back at what we can pull on the dashboard side basically make that all the pieces we put in place are making sense. And yes, even I erase your hand good.
Binaya Tripathi: Yeah, in terms of the resources can this be an example for people onboarding to say for example, a stacks and the download the wallet and now they don't have the stacks needed to pay gas fees. So I want to like the host a contract that sponsors transactions and then gets their first meme going or is there any teas can is that something?
Jason Schrader: Yeah, so that totally could be something you do. We have a link to the software used to sponsor transactions by Alex might be buried somewhere. We're making note here from Alex TX sponsor. I'll get that link put into the notes or I'll shoot it over to you. It's a great idea.
Binaya Tripathi: awesome
Jason Schrader: So you can't have a contract that doesn't go as far as I remember. I think you have to run a service and basically you would receive the transaction minus the payment and then you make the payment as the sponsor. So there might be something to set up there, but it'd be interesting to look at that's easy enough to where if you wanted to you can set one up.
Jason Schrader: cool
Jason Schrader: All So that was a few in the smart contracts and there's a few others like the tools and this one I think is pretty important. Even if it takes a back burner for a little bit but we have this example of how to return two different types of responses in the API based on the payment data in the resource contract. So the first response is like hey you paid for it. Here's your content good to go. The second response is we don't see the payment. Here's your instructions to pay that second one. We should make it a basic standard. I think right now we're just returning function name and arts and contract name which would be enough to call the contract but I would like to get a few more Minds on this and kind of think of what would be the best V1 that we could launch if we were to call a standard and it may be something that as we're recommending this 402 kind of pathway for people and be nice to have something consistent that others could Implement as well.
Jason Schrader: Awesome, and I won't go through all of them. That's just some but the idea is now we have different buckets for tasks and we can focus on those tasks individually and just with the meetings and everything else. Anyone is welcome to contribute. And if anybody wants to be a part of the GitHub or anything else definitely let me know and maybe next week. We'll look at setting up you can do project boards at the organization level. So we'd be able to pull in the issues from different repositories and everything else. So there we can talk about who's doing what progress was made for things that are being acted on just adding that project management piece that I think we were kind of missing.
00:30:00
Jason Schrader: And that was as far as anything I had to present and then I see that question in the chat from J2. So return QR code to point to connector wallet for payments. Yeah, I think there's been a few projects done with the QR codes remembering there was a pay me and stacks button. That was there. I know experts lets you scan QR codes as well. I don't know if there's another way to do it, but have fun with it. I think QR codes are a fun way to get people to B versus having to go through the extra steps read and figure out what link to click on.
Jason Schrader: So I'll go ahead and open up the floor if anybody else has anything else they'd like to share here at the intersection or any thoughts over what we've covered today.
Patrick Stanley: okay, and yeah, I mean and it was kind of funny. We definitely front ran the sort of key opinion leaders or the big big. Names kind of predicting Bitcoin AI would be a thing. And it hasn't yet become a thing. I think they're just, stating that. it will become a thing but I think success looks like I think that the man it could be the thing is it's actually pretty fractured. So I could see success being
Patrick Stanley: And open source, AI models are stored or hashed on chain and you're using whatever model you think you're using this train. what the training has entailed or something like that? I don't know. Because it's hatchable on the blockchain now that itself actually be a pretty huge win. For me personally, I think success looks like agents are Spending money with each other to get resources and just humans do in a regular economy. So you kind of anthropomorphize these agents as actual sentient beings, which maybe you shouldn't but if you were to do that and
Patrick Stanley: do they find it useful to transact with each other? That's the question I personally and curious and want to answer and I think that looks like there's a leaderboard of resources and as a reader leaderboard of resource research AI resources and they can call and call into and pay for and we are kind of describing and that just getting a lot of use I'd say 12 months from now and there's four hundred thousand AI agents that have received a transaction in sbtc in the past.
Patrick Stanley: In the past month, I think that would be pretty huge because that means a lot of microchens are happening and basically what's happening is and you have a beehive a a swarm of bees that are trading information with each other and improving that information and benefiting from it. And so it's like a hive mine upgrading itself with knowledge. I think that'd be kind of cool. But maybe two Fantastical. I don't know. I just like where my head goes.
00:35:00
Binaya Tripathi: Yes, I really like the sound of having, hundreds of thousands of agent interacting with each other, but I'm having our time thinking what kind of behavior would incentivize agents to know what kind of activities would be these agents interacting with? Yeah, and also Patrick briefly mentioned about sentient kind of a behavior through models and I was more thinking instead of them acting sensible. I think maybe we can just have agent with it's specific objective and not letting them diverse two months. So the two parts in my response there so first what kind of behavior or activities with this agents be involved in and about Asians having a specific objectives?
Patrick Stanley: Yeah, I think the behaviors are basically anything that a human can do on the internet. assuming agent's going to be able to do that within a few years. Maybe even a year or two. and autonomously and
Binaya Tripathi: it's just
Patrick Stanley: I think this stuff is hard to sort of Envision because it needs to be like a little micro economy and then the economy grows and grows and grows and you have all these Sort of fractured, sort of little economies that aren't really connected to each other that kind of exists in their own right and…
Binaya Tripathi: yeah.
Patrick Stanley: but I can see
Patrick Stanley: I for one would be willing to pay an AI to do investigative journalism on political dark money. and AI might say hey,…
Binaya Tripathi: Yeah.
Patrick Stanley: and this is a little sci-fi, but it's kind of I don't know sci-fi is cool. And so the AI might be like, okay, we need to get information on this political candidate where the funding sources are from. neither emails cool. We got those and you pay a resource and AI resource to do that. maybe the agent also is …
Binaya Tripathi: Okay.
Patrick Stanley: we need a Voiceover IP, and we need a voice agent to conduct an interview.
Patrick Stanley: So now you have agents actually doing interviews and…
Binaya Tripathi: Okay.
Patrick Stanley: that's one fantastic little kind of idea but just any you guys can do voice ai's can read as type ai's can infer they can do math. they can send emails I don't know. I feel like all those are sort of tasks that are and if a job is done one and an agent can be conscripted into sort of like a crew firm…
Binaya Tripathi: Yeah.
Patrick Stanley: if you will and to accomplishable and…
Binaya Tripathi: Yeah.
Patrick Stanley: maybe they're just loaded up with Bitcoin by humans and let her rips so it goes they get better.
Binaya Tripathi: Yeah, awesome…
NoCode Clarity: You for the presentation here?
Binaya Tripathi: since the iphone find myself around a lot of digital assets interacting with defy. So I was thinking more use cases along those. But yeah, you glad to hear other use cases. So, I think it really depends on what kind of resources are deployed and whose eyes are upon these resources. Thank you.
Jason Schrader: Code sc3 hands up as well and right before that. I just wanted to add on to this idea. So we were talking at the crew AI meet up, I met people who have gone as far as have agents running in their company and replacing what would be traditional employee roles all the way to people who are just looking at the idea and experimenting with it in a common question is where do I start? what should my first agent be and I just want to remind everyone the best way to approach these is to start small because we're really looking at what would be a micro payment or a small interaction and there's the two pieces of the Unix philosophy that are really useful here one is to do one thing and do it. so that would be the resource that you offer. And then expect the output to become an input for something else. So that way you can change these resources together, which I think is going to be some of the power as we let agents make those decisions. So
Jason Schrader: those were my quick thoughts but going off the order of hands. I saw Mike you had yours up first if you had something to share then Dan and Luigi.
mijoco: Yeah, I thanks Jason. Yeah, I was just kind of buzzing off what Patrick was saying and I came across this guy Daniel caiman. Earlier and the thing called thinking fasting in slow and it's about One versus system two thinking. And it's kind of saying the models that we have a system one, but they think fast on their feet they get you the answer. but they're like to get to system two thinking which is much more conceptual and liberate kind of Way of thinking is potentially the use of Agents with models. maybe that's the pathway to that kind of next level. yeah, and then like you say just starting small. I found some good videos that I just shared at the top of the chat by a guy called Matthew Berman. Don't become.
00:40:00
Jason Schrader: Yes. Yeah you.
mijoco: They seems but he seems like into sorry Jason. What do you say?
Jason Schrader: Write some excellent tutorials. Go ahead.
mijoco: Yeah, he seems to be plugged into Ai and where they're going and he's describing the definition of agents in terms of yaml files and talking about the fact that they're going to move to.
Jason Schrader: Yeah, and one of the interesting things there too that I think it's come up in the past. But just in case yaml is actually a really interesting format to use instead of Json because it's much more conversational and it seems to work a little better with the llms and that's something I think we can definitely experiment with and what you were talking about. I think you would really enjoy that more agencies all you need papers as well. There was kind of info there on how to change things together to get to that system to thinking that you're talking about.
Luigi Ottoboni: Yeah, this gives me able to jump out and…
Jason Schrader: that
Luigi Ottoboni: would like to add a decent because I think that is important. We have to change and me and the first our mind and the expect that what is coming out from the agent is stochastic not the precise like the government programming science. So also what we can create or expect there. It is probably at least so this is a way that we have to change our mind that is not easy. But if you follow what the reality is, everything is probability stochastic. So we are margin the reality with the other alarms to today.
Jason Schrader: No problem is good. Thank you for the help with the news as well. That's always much appreciated and we'll look forward to seeing you next week Luigi. And then Dan I know you had your hand up for a bit. Let's get you in.
Dan Trevino: Thank I have a lot and I'll probably be a little bit all over the place on this. You guys can hear me, I'll try and keep this semi-structured but I want to jump around a little bit here because there was a lot to talk about here. First of all, I think many of you are aware that I'm building relaunching boom wallet with focus on payments. There's obviously at least in my mind like a natural tie-in here. To this whole microeconomy that the Patrick was talking about. That's one of the reasons I actually got involved in this from the beginning. Was the potential option to kind of set some default standards around how these things work P2 mentioned, QR codes to point and connect to wallets and paint and payments.
Dan Trevino: From my perspective basically what I'm trying to implement is lightning invoices Ellen URLs, and they have different types of URLs for different types of functions. But ultimately they kind of Define a type of payment and a unique ID and then a recipient and an amount and those kinds of things that Lighting has some peculiarities. They've got I'm in minimum of Maximum payment amount and things like that that don't need to be there but the point is Those kinds of things. Simple standards around how these things are defined are important. I've been working on some of this on my own.
Dan Trevino: and so would appreciate any help around kind of defining these things because I like obviously something that works for people so that in terms of boom we're doing peer to peer I can pay Jason directly with Jason can send me an invoice and I can pay him directly from that invoice but also something that's kind of open to enabling AI to be able to easily read it right and utilize it so if anybody wants to talk about this stuff, I would love some help bounce ideas off of each other and start putting together final specs on the stuff because I needed the other thing is there's another part of this in terms of service Discovery. I think we're talking like some Grand plans about how AI is gonna work.
00:45:00
Dan Trevino: but I think there's some practical measures we can take to get to Step Zero and step one and we haven't talked about these I put together a simple POC for defining types of contracts in my mind
Dan Trevino: there has to be kind of Standards around how contracts are defined because I don't think you want AI to have to parse every contract to see what it can do. I think it's better if we can put some metadata around these contracts or at least parse the contracts in a way that allows us to create metadata easily without having to Define it in a contract but that can Define services. So going back to some existing work that the Bitcoin AI working group is doing along with Noster. They've defined dvms and I talk to Jason about the stuff a while back date of ending machines standards. And so there's some standards there around how you discover services and discover functionality within those services.
Dan Trevino: And again, this is another thing I standards I think that we can start talking about and draft standards not finalizing anything because I think we're early in this whole game. But I think the ability to kind of discover Services easily makes a lot of sense. Like I said, I put together a quick POC to just Define nft contracts, right? We don't have a way to identify Services by the type but we can do a simple trait with chain Hooks and say Yeah, here's all the services that implement this service trait, right? And again just throwing crack out there. I've implemented this with nft contracts so I can go out and discover all the nft contracts easily as a separate entity not using the hero apis.
Dan Trevino: And I think this is another kind of thing that's needed. I had reached out to Friedrich to see if we could talk about how do we Define traits that might just identify a type of contract without having that so easily be spammed. But I think it's another further discussion. I binaya's asking if you need a resource aggregator, we're gonna need some kind of I think in terms of clarity smart contracts. We don't want to parse everything. We want something to aggregate availability. At least that's my kind of simplistic point of view. I think it's easier to just say hey every buddy who's going to create a service like a journalism service or an investigative service you define you implement your contract with some specific trait.
Dan Trevino: And then that way chain hooks or an indexer can pick up any contracts with that trait and say hey,…
Jason Schrader: Yeah, I took some good notes off that and…
Dan Trevino: here's a list of services. So when your ai's looking you can easily go and…
Jason Schrader: just to kind of think back through some of these things.
Dan Trevino: go to an API pull out the list of services or…
Jason Schrader: So first off love to see blue wallet coming back online.
Dan Trevino: have your own index of services and…
Jason Schrader: I'm really excited to see …
Dan Trevino: pull those up and then find the one that's best for…
Jason Schrader: what happens there and…
Dan Trevino: That's just my kind of the things that I've been thinking of.
Jason Schrader: any way we can collaborate or help or make sure standards are aligned.
Dan Trevino: I don't know
Jason Schrader: Let's definitely keep on that.
Dan Trevino: if there's better ways to do this, but part of my question is I love to have those conversations with somebody about better ways to do this…
Jason Schrader: I think some of the flow that I showed in the GitHub, that's probably where we could start issues and just get the discussions going.
Dan Trevino: because I only have my own thoughts and…
Jason Schrader: I think that would be the easiest kind of to start with so I've got a note to create a few around that and…
Dan Trevino: half the time there more tactical than strategic and…
Jason Schrader: I'll invite you to those And cool.
Dan Trevino: so I need another perspective on these things.
Jason Schrader: So looking over the notes here as far as Lightning invoices,…
Dan Trevino: sorry long video
Jason Schrader: we did have a version of the resource contract that would create a unique ID. So definitely happy to share or review some of that code with you if there's something useful for you there.
00:50:00
Jason Schrader: And otherwise I pull on agree that simple standards are important. So, this is a good chance for us to be able to collaborate on these ideas and kind of the same approach we're taking is really people or agents can use the system but we do see that the future of it would be really cool to see a whole bunch of Agents just grabbing things from each other as far as service Discovery goes I think one of the things we can work toward just to have something is if the public contract calls that are doing all the print operations now that we set up that should allow someone running chain hooks or running a service like we talked about a dashboard maybe on Signal 21 and if we were able to get that dashboard set up the difference statistics see the different resources there would also be there API where we pull some of the data with but that's only one data source, the idea of having a standard that we can use and run independently definitely all for that and I think there's something interesting there for the metadata to ideas one one. I just wanted to get out there this whole
Jason Schrader: Public contracts need to print data because it's very useful for anybody using chain Hooks and it eliminates the need to read only calls. So I kind of thought of the original template that's in place for the clarity contracts. Are you title description version some basic information if we took that out of comments and we put that into a certain public function that was tied to a tree that might work really well with the idea you're going around with trigger and I'm definitely happy to jump into that conversation and see a little more about that because we'd be happy to use it. And also LMS are really good at classifying things. So using something like the resources you have built with all of the deployed contracts that are available there on GitHub having an agent go through and process and label and categorize based on a set of criteria is also a really interesting use case that we might be able to explore Looks like we got about four minutes left any other thoughts before we close out.
Jason Schrader: All right. I've got my notes. I promise I'll get these published a lot faster than the past ones have gone and quick note to you uis. So I mentioned in the meeting minutes kind of our comments back and forth. But if there's definitely some room to automate this process and I think you posting your summaries and everything else is super helpful. I think to help publish these faster to we can just put up the transcript maybe in the file or I'm trying to think of the best place to put it and just use the transcript and eventually I'd love to use the audio from the video to create different summaries and everything else but one step at a time and appreciate your help with all that too. And yeah just to finish it out. Thank you everyone for appreciate you being here and we look forward to the call next week. cool. And then last one was the standards in Noster. you definitely brought the nostril nips to me very early on and it's kind of inspired some of the ideas that we've had but there's so much more there that I know I haven't explored. So anybody else who's either deep in that ecosystem or…
Jason Schrader: 
Patrick Stanley: Thanks, Jason.
Louis-Philippe Bellier: leaders
Jason Schrader: interested in this work on these type of Standards.
mijoco: Thanks, Jason. Thanks, everyone.
Nikos Baxevanis: Thank you.
Jason Schrader: There's already some good work that we can build off of and…
Rapha RSierra: Thank you, Jason.
BowTied Radone: Thank you. Bye.
Jason Schrader: I think defining these would just make more approachable for people to be able to come in and…
Binaya Tripathi: By Jason.
Jason Schrader: do similar things.
Binaya Tripathi: Thank you.
Jason Schrader: So to your point about using a trait and chain hooks. That's kind of how we imagine the resource contracts working at first. But that can be upgraded and kind of changed as well. So I think that best takeaway for me there is to create a few issues where we can start these discussions and then start pointing people back to them to see if we can get some more voices. All right, take it.
