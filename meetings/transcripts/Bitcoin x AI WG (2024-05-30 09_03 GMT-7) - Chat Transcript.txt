Mr. Wagmi btc: With the recent buzz of David Bailey (BTC Magazine/Conference) and apparently Musk as well, advising the Trump Administration per their crypto strategy. I wonder if the convergence of AI/BTC is a topic in those conversations. I imagine not. They're probably looking at Bitcoin and then AI separately and haven't conceived the thought yet.

I think its premature. I think the US should first buy $200B BTC with its money printer to neutralize the threat it poses to dollar hegemony.
