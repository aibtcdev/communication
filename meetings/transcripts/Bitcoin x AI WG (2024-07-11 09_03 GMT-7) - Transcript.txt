Jason Schrader: I have been making some updates in the background kind of keeping up with what's going on at crew AI as well. Lots of new features and lots of new things dropping. But as far as the stuff relevant to the working group, let me go ahead and kick that off. Cool, so we have our project. I think we've been I'm not gonna say anything neglecting this from meeting to meeting but we really want to get some more usage out of this board and kind of make the central place to go. So I'll pull this up I think each meeting is good for us to kind of look over what's If there's a task that you would like to pick up or if there's something you want to comment on. This is the place to sort of see everything all in one and I'll actually drop the link here in the chat as well.
Jason Schrader: And would love to see some more people find little pieces. They can take on comment about existing things. We have especially for working towards standards and shout out to anybody who has so far. We're gonna pick up and start doing some more work in these different areas. So if you've already contribute some of this I know Nikos you guys wrote up a lot of great information on the smart contract analysis and buzzing side. This would be a good time to start catching back up with that and getting that implemented into what we're doing.
Jason Schrader: one of the sort of blockers that we had and one of the things that I've been working through is a little bit of how this AI agent crew repositories is structured. So, just a reminder of how we have things. We have the main repository here for the AI agents and then they import the agent tools from a separate repository and we have that ability to add more if we need them. So everything here has been updated and I just wanted to show for looking here.
Jason Schrader: At the just main file list. We had kind of the newest latest iteration of the app right here. We had some older versions that were listed under different names kind of some different things but things are getting messy and feedback. I heard from people trying to work on this or work with it is like what do I do? Which parts do I work with? So this is the fix that's in progress right now. You can see things are much cleaner. And what we've got going on here is the same import for the agent tools.
Jason Schrader: And then a separate folder for that new app that we've been working on as well as a separate folder for some of the Legacy code. So we didn't lose all this information, but we moved it out of the way so that we know we're not using it. We know we're not importing it and we still have it as a reference. So Legacy code still lives there and then in our main app kind of broke this up into a few pieces. The config file itself is gonna go away. And the configuration is going to work directly off the files found in this crew AI directory.
Jason Schrader: And the reasoning here was to help identify which pieces are directly related to Korea So here you can see the definitions. for example, you have the agents. We have our class for a wallet agent that goes over the top of an agent and then we have some decorators methods and definitions here that are used by the UI so you can see here's one for a website Here's one for a meeting writer. We get down to the Bitcoin crew count manager. So on and so forth. what we want the UI to do is this is how people are used to defining agents with Korea So if I was going to have one of their custom tools to find an agent or if I'm going to bring over some agents that I have and some logic I've already written. This is the format that people are used to working with on the code side.
Jason Schrader: And what we wanted to do with that is take it and turn it into a web app that makes things a little bit easier as well. So this makes things like a lot more approachable. The original web app was very messy had all the pieces all together in one. This one is a work in progress, but it's very modular. So you have a tab or item in each. Each one has a separate area that it pulls from the components directory. And basically the purpose of this app is just to give us a web interface into creating those agents working with those tools and a little preview of what that looks like so far is right here if I run the streamlit app, so this comes from the
Jason Schrader: Main file right here. So if you do streamlit run at V1 AI BTC div app and we'll have something in the readme for this. But if you run that file, this is what you get. You can see the five agents and they're related information or synced directly from that file. I showed you before so there's no additional configuration. There's nothing extra that needs to be done. The agents are just pulled in automatically as long as they're defined in the crew AI format. and I think there's a lot we can do with that. You also get the ability to add an agent so you can have a form pulled up here that lets you add a new one to the file. And then you have the ability to sync again from the file in case you've made some changes or some updates and you didn't get a chance to resync here.
00:05:00
Jason Schrader: Each agent contains the ability to edit or delete it the edit will bring up a form currently at the bottom and aside from one little issue with how the tools are listed here. Everything's be coming up correctly and you could actually change that agent and its information or you can go and you can actually delete an agent as well which is going to give us a confirmation button. We're not going to do that now because I don't want to mess up the ones that we have but this is the basic interaction. And the goal that I have for this piece and what I'm trying to finish up to get out to the world here is we'll have a tab for each crew AI related item.
Jason Schrader: So if we go back here and we look we have our agents our crews our tasks and our tools. So for each one of those we'll have that same kind of architecture where you go to the tab. you can sync you can delete. and here you can see a little bit more information about the agents and the different tools. They have configured as well. But that same kind of structure where you can just create update delete, we want to be able to do all that within this application and we can host it on replit so that anybody can jump in and all you have to do is take these default agents. You can add your own you can play with it and you can load up your settings.
Jason Schrader: So the other side of that is over here on the sidebar you could load up your open AI information what model you want to use and a key you can switch over to anthropic if you wanted to you could completely add your own provider, especially if you have something local or something else that you like to use and if you need a API key all that kind of exists here in the sidebar for the configuration. Yeah, I'll kind of pause there.
Patrick Stanley: Any questions from the AI chat box and…
Jason Schrader: This is the main thing that I wanted to show off…
Patrick Stanley: note take it?
Jason Schrader: because I think this particular interaction is going to make the agent part a lot easier for people to interact with so I'll pause there and…
Patrick Stanley: shortly
Jason Schrader: if any questions.
Jason Schrader: cool Yeah. It'd be better, if they could actually contribute a little bit, even if it was just that would be pretty neat to see just feedback of the weird brains. Plus you see what model is powering them too. that's always my question in the background with any of these type of tools.
Jason Schrader: So what I'm seeing as far as what's coming next and where this demo is headed now that we know the structure and once this gets finalized which I'm hoping to finish up today. Next up will be taking a closer look at our bounties and our efforts towards what's going to be built next. I think the last meeting before the holiday we talked about doing some specific tools that do not exist just yet and there was actually a great presentation done at the clarity working group this week that talked about a tool called Clarity in which comes from Hank and it is really cool. It allows you normally to use with testing Suites and you're able to use it to call contracts interact with the way contracts return data, basically.
Jason Schrader: It's a factory for the individual single one-off functions. We've been creating so I definitely can see a bounty for the integration there. And I've laid out some of the initial work and thinking around that in our issues so you can see that one.
Jason Schrader: definitely all doctors recommend Clarity again. it's huge. it's something that basically you provide the contract and you can interact with it without needing to build all the individual functions and all the data maps and the variables there's a lot of code that we end up writing in the background that is very repetitive and could be But generating it, is that whole extra step this package does that it's gone through a lot of improvements. There's also some really good documentation. So I see one of our neck in bounties being the implementation of this and seeing what kind of amazing things we can do there.
00:10:00
Jason Schrader: Another one will be the continuation of tools. So we do want to have some basic things like being able to transfer Stacks being able to transfer a sip nine or set 10 of any name or of a provided contract name and similar. So those will be all outlined. But the main priority right now is just to get this structure done so that we know what we're updating and we're all jumping into that same familiar code base. and also on the board, so that's kind of on the tooling side. There's another PR that I just finished up. There was some old naming and information within the tools. And we started to update that so it looks a little cleaner as well. So you can see that instead of having some of the old names are like the stacks M2M type stuff.
Jason Schrader: So we've removed that we've got one for the token one for the resources and It was an open pull request about adding the smart contract for a vault. So all the different pieces are kind of laid out here and I think our job is going to go through them and figure out which ones make sense for the next Bounty small steps towards getting a big result.
Jason Schrader: Did anybody else have anything that they would like to provide either demo or…
Patrick Stanley: What appears to be an AI agent to basically self-replicate itself and grow?
Jason Schrader: presentation-wise or just some more information about this particular intersection or any news just curious if anybody else has anything here? Yeah, it's funny I saw the post and I was like, wow, I wonder how they're doing that then I've seen some follow-up posts to how that's turned out and what's going on with it. And I think it's an interesting experiment knowing what the flows are very interesting to me and I think the other reason I'm excited about this particular structure that I'm working on is I want to be able to turn the agents on themselves. So if I have a defined place where agents task tools all these individual items go then I can teach through a prompt that hey
Jason Schrader: This is where all that information can be found. This is how you set one up. This is what it looks like as an example. And then you've got it sort of creating its own tools its own tasks, which in my mind. That's the long game that we need to get to as we do need these things to be generative. And I also think allowing people to experiment and create their own in as many ways as possible or kind of the two angles that we can provide. That would be really interesting.
Jason Schrader: Basically, I want some agents that I can have running pretty much 24/7 on my machine and I haven't seen anything like that yet. I mean there are some experiments like you can run certain games or you can run like A Game of Life type scenario where you let it play out and go through but particularly for the wallet actions and the things we're trying to do on chain. that's what seems really interesting to me.
Patrick Stanley: you
Jason Schrader: Yeah, so the two things I was thinking of really at this point. Is that the integration of clarityn? how can we use that to make interacting with contracts easier even just identifying what our pattern is because a lot of these
Jason Schrader: that cool in particular your goal is to define a pattern that works for every case. And once you have that magic pattern, then you can basically just interact with any contract on the blockchain. So there's a huge unlock there. But there's some gray areas that might need my Carson back and forth or I don't know how simple it'll be as a bounty but that is one on my mind that I'd like to outline for that. Otherwise the creation of tools, I think even if we split them up a little more granular and we said, this much for this tool like what are we missing to achieve the goals that we want for each agent and what other tools do we need there's Clarity and clarinet are both really strong on the testing and interacting with contracts to figure out a few more as well. But that's my goal. I think let's put it that way by the next meeting so when we get together on Thursday,
00:15:00
Jason Schrader: July was I gonna be 18. Yeah. So when we get together on Thursday, July 18th, let's plan to discuss the next wave of bounties what's going on and we'll be able to show off a little more of this whole interface and how it's working as well because both are definitely in motion. They just didn't make it to the table for first days meeting.
Jason Schrader: Great.
Jason Schrader: All that negative find my mute button. Yeah This looks really awesome. and I think this is great so that the localized AI models, that's an interesting topic. There's
Jason Schrader: that is one side of it and then you have the take that Venice AI is taking as well same kind of thing of like making sure that the information we're passing through to these llms if you're not sure I mean let me put it this way just assume everything is being tracked right assume every piece of information that we offer to anybody offering an LM service is It's going to be evaluated. It's gonna be used for training when you look at things through that lens. That's where you realize why we're going to need local AI That's on par with it because a lot of times there's gonna be data that we don't want just shared and consumed and also what's been shared by this team over at Venice which I'm sure it was shared by the shared view by the tether team as well is once let's say you have a history of all this information. You've been chatting back and forth with an llm what happens when that gets tied.
Jason Schrader: To you as a person once that's done. It can't really be undone and it can be really revealing depending on how much information you're working back and forth with using the llm. So definitely a lot of considerations there and I think that that is definitely something worth reading and looking into I dropped the link to Venice and here as well and then on the topic of This editor here. I really love this little idea. I mean, that's something that like trying to create a sip or looking over a sip or messing with a sip is definitely a challenging thing for those who don't know a stiff a sip is a Stacks Improvement proposal. So it comes here from the sips repo. You can see some of the different information that's going on. Some of the different ones that we've had in the past and I'm curious if let's go ahead and take one here.
Jason Schrader: And see what it thinks.
Jason Schrader: for this tool is this just using gbt for I see it at the bottom. It's using Sonic in the background.
Jason Schrader: possibly, one of the challenges that I've seen with these kind of things is like if you don't give any direction the recommendations might not be the same each time. So the thing to remember there is just that you want to have the instructions that you're giving it.
Jason Schrader: Giving you the intended results. So what I mean by that is one time it might say. Hey, let's vote this way. The second time you ask it might say. Hey, let's vote that way. which one is the better recommendation? What's the right thing for the protocol to do instead of just giving you the answer though, maybe that's a good conversation to have too. It's like if you had a chain of prompts where you can say okay, this is what I'm thinking and we go back and forth until we get to a final result something like that could be really useful as well. But definitely every step along the way I mean analysis of data looking at how these different things are. I see the points of well formed and is it original is it appropriate? I think that's pretty cool to see and I also hope so with it being it and already past it that it would meet the criteria.
00:20:00
Jason Schrader: I think that covers everything for this week. We can kind of make it a quick meeting here and things off but just like I was saying earlier, it's definitely ramp up and get ready next week. We'll talk more about bounties. we'll talk more about the kind of tasks. We can complete and I like this idea of what we've jungle around a few ideas with GPT and doing things like Clarity auditing or doing things like this where it's like editing or sip reviewing. it really love to compare how this is set up with gpt4 in the background to how this could use a team of crew with tasks just because that might unlock more interaction more consistency more information. and more than just being able to paste it in and get a result. I think there's
Jason Schrader: something there that we could definitely play with and I think this defines an interesting role for an agent or a crew to be able to help with
Jason Schrader: Yeah, just really looking forward to sharing more with everybody next week. So you know that we'll set that date on our calendar same time as usual at nine am and I will see you and all the lovely AI meet meeting notes that we have in the meeting.
Patrick Stanley: Thanks, Jason Thanksgiving.
Jason Schrader: All right. Thanks everybody.
BowTied Radone: Thank you.
