## AIBTCdev Thursday, Apr 4

Video + Recap: Thursday, Apr 4

### Working Group Updates

New [sprint sync posted](https://github.com/orgs/stacks-network/discussions/533#discussioncomment-8997074) with updated goals

- create revenue sharing smart contract
- create agent to configure/deploy contracts
- test/troubleshoot running a crew on Replit
- any ideas or contributions are welcome!

[Nakamoto block chosen](https://twitter.com/muneeb/status/1775847964742693219) for Stacks upgrade!

- new PoX-4 contract deployed, new Nakamoto rules in place
- features like fast blocks activate mid-May
- huge focus for the Stacks ecosystem, sBTC next

**Call to action:** anyone feel called to get involved?

- more engagement on GitHub, Twitter, and meetings
- anyone want to tackle a small piece for the group?
- focus on unblocking others to work collaboratively

Some ideas/asks for what to build next:

- could drop a bounty to see things built faster
- improve the Streamlit UI using a new [example from crewAI community](https://youtu.be/nKG_kbQUDDE)
- agent that trades memecoins on Stacks
- agent that analyzes a smart contract (h/t mrwagmi.btc)
- agent that helps configure and deploy a resource contract
- any new ideas? let's divide and conquer!

Different areas to contribute: review [How to Get Involved](https://github.com/orgs/stacks-network/discussions/534#discussioncomment-8946308)

### Latest AI News

Generative AI landscape for 2024 (h/t Chris)

- huge [Landscape chart](https://mad.firstmark.com/) and [all-in-one graphic](https://twitter.com/AiBreakfast/status/1775551782183125439)
- so much to learn, grateful we all get together

[Removing layers](https://twitter.com/AlphaSignalAI/status/1774858806817906971) and retaining performance

- neural networks are hard to understand
- we're in the "make it work" phase
- huge win for OSS models and reduced sizes/requirements overall

Full Stack loop idea from [Balaji in a fireside chat](https://youtu.be/wOMZOYfpOCY?si=72wnBnaKQxukDT6o&t=1940)

- small data set
- train a model
- publish model
- evaluate result
- add data
- train a model
- publish data
- evaluate result
- repeat

Pay per token on evaluations.

Crowdfunding next training run.

Distributed GPU access for training in future iteration.

Reduced loop:

- Data Collection
- Training
- Distribution
- Loop

AI agent workflow: [self-reflection from Sequoia Capital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sal78ACtGTc)

- one-shot generation then ask LLM to review
- perfect fit for agents/flows in crewAI

Similar: [self-reflective RAG](https://blog.langchain.dev/agentic-rag-with-langgraph/)

- get data from RAG, then evaluate it
- multi-step processes are necessary for consistency

Devin clones: [OpenDevin](https://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin), [Devika](https://github.com/stitionai/devika) and [SWE-Agent](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent)

- different approaches to the same problem
- excellent SWE-Bench performance
- primarily focused on GitHub for now

Lots of posts about agentic AI

- a [deep dive](https://x.com/IntuitMachine/status/1775837316570898939?s=20) into Agentic AI by Carlos Perez
- helps to frame what we're doing with crewAI

### Development Updates

Cloudflare Workers now [support Python!](https://blog.cloudflare.com/python-workers/?s=09)

- would love to test with [crewAI](https://x.com/whoabuddydev/status/1775531748597883109?t=Jct55H0E8SjXdXyIriAsTw&s=09)
- also interested in their AI model work
- cheapest way to deploy/experiment

New release candidate for CrewAI v0.27.0rc1

- improves memory functions, agents can remember context
- human in the loop (human input) now available
- RAG tools now support open models
- Enhanced cache control

Future of the wallet: [JSON RPC](https://github.com/wbips/wbips-docs)

- inspired by [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/web3wallet) and [WebBTC](https://github.com/BitcoinAndLightningLayerSpecs/WebBTC/)
- documentation [deployed on Netlify](https://wbips.netlify.app/)
- Unified standard between Xverse, Asigna, Leather, and more
- easy way to access L1 and L2 wallet functions
- better suited than workaround we have

### Discussion

Patrick: decision point for the working group direction

- do we want to focus on Balaji's loop example above?
- do we want to focus on AI agents as economic actors?

Luigi: fine-tuning is black magic

- same data can give different results (tools, settings, etc)
- catastrophic forgetting is possible where fine-tune makes the model worse
- might not be easy, but is time well spent (results can be better than big models)
- well-trained SLM beats an LLM in speed and cost

Luigi: other options for training

- can add weights to a model like Llama
- can iterate very quickly

Patrick: adding a payment layer to big APIs isn't interesting enough

- we could be censored
- using hosted APIs could be a weakness
- become a Bitcoin x AI network

Chris: add value, next up: produce

- people waiting for their turn to play
- allow the WG to make suggestions
- DePIN getting big, FileCoin front-runner ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-depin-physical-infrastructure-blockchain))
- What can AI on Bitcoin do for Depin? Then make report
- game-changer for people finding their way
- flywheel: case studies, we have a grant, tasks to offload
  - post bounties to produce a product
  - further validate thesis of Bitcoin x AI

Patrick: let's be clear on where we're going

- completed Phase 0 (pretty much)
- what are Phase 1 / Phase 2 / Phase 3?
- need to be clear to prevent churn
- open to potentially funding grants

Richard: set objective with constraints

- agents that can deploy contracts
- set some constraints, keep it simple
- go after it, can explore more as it goes

Chris: cadence, flow is mentioned, what's the first step?

- same phase talk, can we vote/decide as a group?

Hero Gamer: with the DeGrants hat on

- would it help if we thought about end consumer?
- what application will come out of it?
- have people submit ideas through DeGrants categories, targeted at a specific area
- take best ideas, sprint and develop, repeat
- break Ready Layer 2 track down to subcategories, ask for ideas

Louis-Philippe Bellier

- What I keep seeing seeing in my brain being in these meetups: Building the best AI documentation trained AI agent to rule all bitcoin trades with all wrapper/dual/triple/etc BTC-related tokens (sBTC, wBTC, xBTC, etc...) as fully autonomous agents. ðŸ˜…

### Available Tasks

h/t to @lpbellier for making a task list, slightly revised version below after today's call.

- [ ] Identify next phases and goals for the group, to be finalized next week
- [ ] Discuss strategies for increasing adoption and growing the AI BTC economy

The other tasks listed can be reincorporated once we decide on our overall direction and there are plenty ways to contribute.

If the topic of Bitcoin x AI is interesting to you please [join a meeting](https://evt.to/emamdeggw) and get involved!
