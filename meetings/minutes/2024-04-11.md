A [Deep dive into CrewAI](https://blog.composio.dev/crewai/?s=09) from Composio

- good overview of [the basic concepts](https://docs.crewai.com/)
- working code examples

Shared link: [Chat Arena Leaderboard](https://chat.lmsys.org/)

- real comparisons side by side of models
- ranking shows which OSS models perform better
- also on [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard)

Shared link: [Praison AI](https://github.com/CMPGFB/PraisonAI/tree/develop)

- leverages both AutoGen and CrewAI or any other agent framework
- represents a low-code, centralised framework designed to simplify the creation and orchestration of multi-agent systems for various LLM applications
- emphasizes ease of use, customization, and human-agent interaction

### Development Updates

Quick demo of "Share Thoughts"

- goal of passing thoughts to agents
- finding places in our workflow that are worth it

### Available Tasks

Let's focus on creating an agent that deploys a contract.

We can keep it simple, starting with a resource.
