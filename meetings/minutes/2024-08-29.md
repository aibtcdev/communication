### Development Updates

Shout out to Human for adding a [Wallet Summarizer crew](https://github.com/aibtcdev/ai-agent-crew/pull/19)

- exploring how to display multiple in UI
- we now have two solid examples as templates
- using Ollama and double-checking OSS support

Also a big shout out for early work [on the Bitflow SDK](https://docs.bitflow.finance/bitflow-documentation/developers/bitflow-sdk)

- currently a [WIP PR on GitHub](https://github.com/aibtcdev/agent-tools-ts/pull/38)
- blocker: some parts expect the Connect object StacksProvider

### Demo Time

Let's see these crews in action!

- will update Replit so others can fork/play with their keys
- will host this version at a subdomain of our website
- will follow the loose [roadmap posted on X](https://x.com/aibtcdev/status/1828921657899266113)

How can we improve our crews? Collaboration!

- e.g. work with Orange Hats on Clarity auditing reports
- allow access for others to use with API (next goal)
- CrewAI has a [built-in training feature](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Training-Crew/) too!
