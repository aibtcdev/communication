### Working Group Updates

Workshop presentation for Ready Layer 2

CrewAI released a new version with new formats

- new release post [available on Twitter](https://twitter.com/whoabuddydev/status/1767603353293656081)
- supports creating a crew through their CLI tool
- agent and task definitions in YAML (easier to read/update)
- can interpolate a dict of inputs to the crew too!
- includes enterprise support, crews as APIs
  - great fit for our resource and gated API example
- 90% implemented in our repo, still working out a few details
- decided better to support multilple package managers, not just poetry (BYO)

Reminder: a [custom GPT is available](https://chatg.pt/DWjSBZn) for CrewAI too!

### Latest AI News

- Cognition Labs [introduced Devin](https://twitter.com/cognition_labs/status/1767548763134964000) ([blog](https://www.cognition-labs.com/blog))
  - UX here is smooth, different from just chatting
  - see potential to create similar interactions with CrewAI
  - tabs to watch agent progress, UI coming soon for CrewAI
  - ASK: anyone know what model is used behind the scenes?
- Trying out Claude over GPT-4 lately and impressed so far
  - longer context is helpful on certain tasks
  - small UX goes a long way: long paste doesn't clutter prompt
  - accurate on coding tasks so far
- Claude-in-Sheets prompting resource [shared on Twitter](https://x.com/DynamicWebPaige/status/1767945246535815237?t=YBN4SDL4BeMJ4YYz6D9rpA&s=09)
  - lots of good examples / ideas
- Eric Hartford created a script to [dump a github repo to text](https://x.com/erhartford/status/1767284737788514724?t=5EBIlK3zdZGKRI_6fcsE4A&s=09)
  - useful with long context LLMs
  - used it to [submit a PR](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI/pull/348) to CrewAI!

### Development Updates

Making steady progress on our sprint:

- set back a little by latest CrewAI changes
- SIP-018 verification is working, needs implementation
- implement new CrewAI tooling, including search and RAG
- implement aBTC as gas on testnet ([example](https://github.com/alexgo-io/stacks-transaction-sponsor))
- create easy-to-clone template of Bitcoin AI Crew

Some ideas/asks for what to build next:

- could drop a bounty to see things built faster
- agent that trades memecoins on Stacks
  - access ALEX DEX for prices
  - access stats about each coin
  - make decisions / swaps
  - rate it's own performance
- agent that analyzes a smart contract (h/t mrwagmi.btc)
  - explains contract functions, actions in clear words
  - evaluates contract for risks or exploits
- agent that helps configure and deploy a resource contract
  - abstract wallet requirements away from the user
  - make it simple and approachable, frictionless
  - Streamlit UI could collect/pass data to agents

Shout-outs:

- @dreight shared a [Microsoft blog post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-math-demonstrating-the-potential-of-slms-with-model-specialization/) about how a specialized smaller models perform well when trained on the right data
- @davek-btc is developing a CLI tool for on-chain information in Go, and is interested in [helping to port it over](https://github.com/aibtcdev/agent-tooling-go) for agents to use as tooling
- @hero-gamer offered to help [get the word out](https://twitter.com/herogamer21btc/status/1768323059088228807) across different communities to help explore more agent use cases and necessary tooling
- @dreight shared a [Medium post from Elya Livshitz](https://betterprogramming.pub/yaml-vs-json-which-is-more-efficient-for-language-models-5bc11dd0f6df) regarding YAML vs JSON for large language models
