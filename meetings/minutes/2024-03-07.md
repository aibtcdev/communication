Script implemented that can:

- sign a message with a private key
- extract the public key from signed message
- use the public key to verify signature

This unlocks a few use cases, mainly in how an agent can represent its identity.

This will be used as agent tooling, allowing an agent to sign and verify messages.

This will also be used with the gated API to prove a request is coming from the address that paid an invoice in the smart contract before providing access.
