#### Demo Questions

- Can you walk us through your development process and any challenges you faced?
- How do you envision AI agents using your tool in real-world scenarios?
- Were there any surprising discoveries or learnings during the development of your tool, particularly regarding how it handles error cases or unexpected inputs from AI agents?
- What other tools or capabilities do you think AI agents need to effectively interact with blockchains?

### Development Updates

Tease the [website rebrand preview](https://feat-rebrand-website.aibtcdev-landing-page.pages.dev/)

Updated [UI for agents](https://github.com/aibtcdev/ai-agent-crew/pull/12) using Streamlit

- pulls in all agents, tools, and tasks from the code
- provides an execution tab to monitor agent operation
- [hosted on replit](https://replit.com/@wbtc402/ai-agent-crew), makes it easy to fork and play with
- next up: exposing as an API (looking at CrewAI+ still!)

Blocked: git-lfs storage for audio/video

- we store all of our [meeting records on GitHub](https://github.com/aibtcdev/communication)
- we are currently using 8gb/1gb allotted space
- we could increase but cost ramps up
- trying to get things working with [git-lfs + Cloudflare R2](https://github.com/aibtcdev/git-lfs-s3-proxy)

## Mission Statement

We have some material prepared but ran out of time, it will be posted to the [communication repo](https://github.com/aibtcdev/communication) so we can all collaborate on it before the next meeting.
