**CrewAI live demo:**

We walked through a live demo using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, but you can swap those out for any model running an OpenAI compatible API using environment variables.

The agent demo starts at 10:42 [in the video](https://twitter.com/whoabuddydev/status/1763328554597843133).

Testing will continue against open source models once we get the big rig back up and healthy again! ðŸ˜…
