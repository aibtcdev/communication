- our way of organizing all in one place
- plan to report statuses, discuss during meetings

Crew for [meeting notes updates](https://github.com/aibtcdev/ai-agent-crew/issues/4)

- early iteration still doesn't get to the result
- prompting and order of tasks is essential
- scoping down to just X posts for simplicity
- next step: use custom GPT with:
  - example of raw data dumped over the week
  - example of finished news agenda items
  - prompt: how to get from A to B?
- working side-by-side until it takes over

### Demo Time

Expanding on the concept of ["crew as a company"](https://github.com/aibtcdev/smart-contracts/issues/4#issuecomment-2139898359)

- the company should be governed by the blockchain
- smart contracts can enforce the rules / structure
- lots of pieces: company token, revenue sharing, etc
- Executor DAO is a [powerful template on Stacks](https://github.com/MarvinJanssen/executor-dao)

Dividing the topic into three main categories

- Top-level registrar, community-curated source of truth
- Company DAO structure, with proposals and extensions
- Company can create subDAOs for segmentation (departments)
  - Can have it's own treasury / budget
  - Can have it's own voting / spending rules
  - Can contain another subDAO _(for Inception fans)_
