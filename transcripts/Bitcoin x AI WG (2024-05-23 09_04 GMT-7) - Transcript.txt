Jason Schrader: Exactly get removed automatically there but I think they'll be able to jump back in anyway, working group updates. Just kind of the general overview. We have the main website at AI BTC dot Dev main GitHub org same name. That's where all the different repositories everything else lives. The latest meeting notes are posted for last week. They can be found in the original issue that we have around our working group just like before so we have those and actually they're also posted in our Communications repo. So we have this location that we can use the feed agents more information and just to have a running copy and be able to pull all the individual minutes in an easier way than having to deal with the issue online. So all of that is kind of a running tally of where the One thing to note about last week is we did not get a meeting transcription. I thought the setting was enabled wasn't this time.
Jason Schrader: And we'll see how it goes. But it's a good chance to look at how to use a crew in place of the manual process too. So this was a pretty cool find it will actually just take a video up to 15 minutes in length. Send it off to gpto and create a viral a shorter clip from it. So I thought that would be something kind of fun to experiment with plus it'll give us part of the workflow towards taking the audio and creating an actual transcript versus relying on another service to do it.
Jason Schrader: So thought that was a cool way to kind of round out the meeting notes and everything else the other kind of main working group update. We had a meeting with Joe and Rob over on the crew AI team. So we're still working towards access to crew AI plus seemed like great reception there definitely interested in what we're doing and I think we can leverage our knowledge and abilities to become sort of the crypto arm for AI is they're looking at different things that can integrate everything else. Basically the message there is that we will get you updated as soon as we have more information on that. Cool, and I'll kind of pause there next I'm going to jump into the latest AI news but just if anybody new wants to kind of introduce themselves say how they found the group or what they're looking for out of it or if you're working on anything at that AI Bitcoin intersection. I'm just kind of pause there.
Patrick Stanley: Did anyone knew find this from Twitter? or if you're new to this chat with you, I would love to know how you found that because we'll do more of that.
Jason Schrader: Yep, we'll just kind of jump in Go ahead the next.
Patrick Stanley: Okay.
Patrick Stanley: Yeah, welcome.
Jason Schrader: Yeah, it's amazing. next up we'll just jump into the AI news and kind of talk about some of the more recent stuff going on starting out with a really big post here coming from Arthur Hayes and definitely read to take a huge look at everything going on here. It's a lot to digest but it's a lot of really just to give you the quick points on what's going on is organization is a key to how a society can succeed.
00:05:00
Jason Schrader: And we've seen llc's kind of create the rise of individual companies small ideas capitalism as it is that that's what the engine was that created it and when we're looking at the AI side of things a lot like the theories we presented, we could imagine ai's using dowels on blockchains instead of traditional companies. So same reasons that we're looking to a wallet as an account identifier both for identity and for the ability to move and transfer and…
Patrick Stanley: Yeah. Yeah, basically.
Jason Schrader: hold assets. Also using the blockchain structure to Define company operations or…
Patrick Stanley: if agents are kind of Like employees or…
Jason Schrader: to Define how things work. It's really a good fit for a machine-led world,…
Patrick Stanley: autonomous individuals on the internet. sometimes individuals start companies and
Jason Schrader: for talking about agents having their own personalities and we already kind of Envision this too with if you're offering a resource,…
Patrick Stanley: some of those companies are worth millions of dollars each and…
Jason Schrader: if you're doing something with agents, you're essentially creating a company.
Patrick Stanley: they only start with a little bit of Revenue and…
Jason Schrader: So that was really cool to see that in alignment, but some really good points made in here too,…
Patrick Stanley: and that
Jason Schrader: just
Jason Schrader: How Dallas would boost in this case it's pointed aetherium,…
Patrick Stanley: That just helps create more wealth more options.
Jason Schrader: but it would boost transactions decks operations become critical…
Patrick Stanley: You can borrow against that value Etc. I like the way Arthur kind…
Jason Schrader: because then you have the layer that enabled being especially for new assets…
Patrick Stanley: If you scroll up a little bit Jason or…
Jason Schrader: if they're generated or associated with a company.
Patrick Stanley: go to the poet…
Patrick Stanley: where the poet structure is. Yeah.
Jason Schrader: And …
Jason Schrader: it gives that chance to use the blockchains transparency for good. So I thought that was pretty neat.
Patrick Stanley: No, there's bullets.
Jason Schrader: I'll pause there.
Patrick Stanley: Sorry you're yeah,…
Jason Schrader: I don't know if you wanted to add any more to that Patrick.
Patrick Stanley: there it is. And the show is an example of …
Jason Schrader: This is a good article that you shared.
Patrick Stanley: how an AI Dow could be set up. So in this example, here's a thing called poetdowell. AI I believe you pay the Dow for a poem and the thou will generate a poem for you and it's just a simple idea just to explain how a doubt could work that has some utility instantly And now this is not it. Sorry. Can you go up? and keep scrolling up until you find the
Patrick Stanley: Yeah, keep going up. No, I mean sorry. middle to top. Thanks. Keep going. Yeah, you go. There it is. So here he has one a finite number of poet tokens are created. So let's say a million poet tokens are created. Those 80% of the tokens are retained by Poet AI. And the doubt like the Dow or the craters of the down twenty percent are available to sale. So in this case, he's suggesting doing a sale to raise Capital to continue working on the Dow itself to continue fine-tuning and making the service better and better. and so each token equals one governance vote and then
Patrick Stanley: profits are paid out directly to token holders so 75% of the profits. from performing the service from the crew performing the service and goes out to the holders of the governance token in 25% I get to reinvested to improve the service. And then if you want to change any of these Provisions above you have to do it requires 95%
Patrick Stanley: agreement votes That's an important thing. You're basically securing. All those rules will likely and be persistent. And so the whole reason he structures that this. Is to avoid and needing to have laws that those two things see trying to avoid their needing to be laws that force. Real world contracts it's all on chain and all enforceable on chain and with a really high degree of certainty. and since you're not issuing stock where there can be.
Patrick Stanley: there's an obvious exit where the IPO or they get bought by private Equity Firm by creating the sort of dividend 75% of the profits go directly to governance tokenholders. What you're doing is you're Revenue in real time. So that people can evaluate whether in fact it is worth holding this token, now today, you're not anticipating some liquidation event and 10 years down the road you're actually able to assign value to a very early on. So Jason, and I kind of like this idea of creating AI dials that have Basically their own token for governance and ownership that yields a dividend.
00:10:00
Patrick Stanley: As a function of the services it provides and gets paid to do so you can pay any these Dows to perform a service for you. And the holders of the token receive some portion of those profits. That's the basic just and the reason I think this is important. is like if you just were to start with if you had no ability to fundraise for these things, it would just make it so much more difficult to get Services spun up and to keep people's focus on the services. but if you're able to create company capital structure you're able to do fundraising you're able to issue dividends and you're basically able to spend more time and focus building this out and giving your
Patrick Stanley: agents down and the ecosystem higher chance of succeeding. I'll just stop there but those kind of what we like about this model like all smart contract enforceable. No Reliance on the outside world. and higher than higher likelihood of success and then just being a lemonade stand and just selling lemonade inside the street, and hoping people show up and live kind of living are by whether you make money that day. it allows for a little bit longer term thinking on these dowels.
Jason Schrader: Let's see who's in my good?
mijoco: Yeah, I mean that's several really interesting things going on here for me and I saw you posted something about executed there as well. Didn't you turn the week in quite catch that but look.
Jason Schrader: Yeah, …
Jason Schrader: and when I'm looking at the structure that we kind of identified before on how to do Revenue sharing and a few other things. I think it's such an excellent fit because you have the room to do extensions or a great fit for how the revenue model and where funds get held and everything else and then you have proposals which could handle the token sales that was an option. We're creating a modular bolt-on version of what we're seeing in some of these ideas would be my end goal. Yeah that please go ahead. I know you've had a ton of experience as well.
mijoco: I did.
mijoco: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it ties in with what I've been doing with sdx CCO and Kind of trying to find a use case for that project and not really succeeding and yes, it's been good for voting but it'll be really nice to be able to use it because is that it's the ecosystem down framework. Is it executed our framework? That's kind of deployed Unchained. but it's just did a kind of minimum usage at the moment and
mijoco: the other thing I was going to say Jason just responding to your question earlier about the course and kind of where I've been trying to get to testing the resource contract and framework and what I realized by doing the course was the limitation I think is really my Mac and how I can run models locally and then I kind of started running it on GPT for I think over the API and then I started starting the money ratcheting up on doing that and I thought rather than do that that's not really viable kind of as that's gonna get expensive quite quickly. I researching gpus and realizes are quite a big deal to run services. So I'm looking at this thing llama. Limata, I think there's a course on How to Train models.
mijoco: and the goal now is to kind of set but a rig a home with my partner Mark who's a hardware expert and try and figure out how we can train a small alarm at 3 7B model on Stacks data and start getting something interesting that I can run locally and Kind of controlled the costs of doing so that that's kind of been the journey but I did find with the course. I can see the difference between the performance of these models and that the really limiting factor is just the way I'm running the locally.
Jason Schrader: That's huge. I think it's about a month ago or two months ago. We were talking about this being one of the goals, of the group was getting a little more into training and mostly just curating really good data that used for that training process. So the fact that you're doing that would love to jam some more just on where you're at, if there's anywhere that we can help with some of the resources we have same with collaboration, I think the training data end goal it would be great. If we had something we could publish boom you want to add stacks and Bitcoin here's a big package and…
00:15:00
mijoco: Yeah.
Jason Schrader: ideas for what to add to it. So yeah, we'd love to hear more on what's going on there and it is tough. when you're looking at a 70 or some of these smaller models. they're not quite as capable. But I feel like there's still so many letters to pull, between the problem and the way you split up tasks and the way you assign things. So yeah would definitely like to learn more about you learnings there. let's find a touch base again and look into
mijoco: I am the other thing I did was I dropped it into git up. I think I dropped link somewhere. Can't remember maybe on this group's discussion on GitHub, but I created a repo with all the examples but brought on to the latest version of crew AI.
Jason Schrader: Yeah that happens.
Jason Schrader: Yeah, it's great. I'm gonna run back and grab that for sure. I'll find that make sure we get that into the notes too so we can get that updated and in there and yeah, I think the more examples we have the faster we can get people to that standing start so you can really start experimenting with what the agents do and what kind of tasks they complete. That's huge one. So definitely appreciate that.
Jason Schrader: Guys, that's definitely another piece that we needed to so really really good to look at that. Thank you.
Jason Schrader: All right. that was huge lot came out of that post. I think there's so much information to digest there. it says staying on the article and everything else will kind of move on but if there's any big points that people want to feel free to bring those back to the meeting or anywhere in the notes or follow up with the GitHub. All of that is welcome.
Jason Schrader: Cool next news item that I had a year. If you haven't seen it yet near blockchain near protocol is looking to own this user owned AI segment. So they've announced a ton of Grants and ideas coming up to Inky day and invest in AI infrastructure. So they're hitting all the key points that we've seen in other networks. So, we have compute and inferences one variable data curation and how to reward people for curating it crowdsourcing or synthetic data marketplaces and then identic infrastructure. So kind of everything if you look at it that way but we're looking at the same exact thing here on the Bitcoin side. So it's always good to see what others are up to with some of the early projects are and where we're at in comparison. So I thought that was pretty cool.
Jason Schrader: let's see if
Jason Schrader: All right, another big one that's come out is co-pilot PCS. So it was kind of funny when gpt40 came out and they said they were going to make an application for the desktop. one of the bigger criticisms that was early on was that wow, open AI has this partnership with Microsoft and the first app they're going to create is going to be a Mac app.
Jason Schrader: And I thought that was pretty funny. But then I saw this release and things started to make a little more sense. So what they're doing is using gpt40 on the desktop for Microsoft products as well, but they're doing it through their own branding through the co-piloting. So this was just in the article and update on what they're going to be able to do. It's basically the same idea you have a running app on your computer. You can share context back to the AI very simply be it through screenshot or anything else and then AI can perform tasks on the computer as well. So I think this is something that for any operating system, we're gonna see a lot of really cool Integrations coming up and it's essentially the personal assistance. We always want it if we look back on our series and bixby's and other options. They never quite made it they were useful, but they just weren't what we wanted them to be and I see that coming really soon.
Jason Schrader: Another thing on the Microsoft side was there was a big outage with Bing. So what was interesting there is what all went down. And of course Brave is the competitor here. So they're gonna talk about it. But there was an API issue with being that took down Duck Go pilot chat DPS web search. And a few other services that were pretty big as well. So just that one outage and kind of the same if we've seen it with cloudflare or another big company has an outage but it's a reminder that we want to have as much decentralization of these Services as possible and one of the things of course, I love about Crews we can run against several different apis configurations models even locally. So it's kind of a win point there and a reminder.
00:20:00
Jason Schrader: And another thing I saw that was interesting is GitHub co-pilot. For example, somebody was trying to put in some code and it was censored. So we see this in some of the bigger models and it's been kind of something that I think fundamentally is going to be an issue with training and everything else is like training the model to respond in a certain way and that ends up being such an issue because you end up with this is just somebody filling out some code. It would be totally normal. But it will not complete just because it thinks it's inappropriate.
Jason Schrader: All right, and then next up this little visual, let me see if it'll let me.
Jason Schrader: Pop it back into the window here. I love finding this one obviously you get a lot of this generated or think they kind of crap on the bottom. But this graphic in particular just shows you for those base models for those main ones that we're looking at over time over 12 months. You can just see how the scores have been moving and how things have been kind of tying together. I always think those visuals are interesting just want to throw it in there link will be in the meeting notes as usual. And almost done here next up cloudflare had a huge release. So the AI Gateway is now General availability. So with this allows you to do is when we're setting a custom. AI
Jason Schrader: Custom AI API it's always hard to say, but when we're using a custom AI API. It's really just one setting change in crew. We change the base URL and that gets updated and used so you can use your local models. You can use anything else same thing for using the cloudflare AI Gateway, which is why I thought this was pretty relevant to the group. It gives you just something that you can put in front of all of your different Services. You can also switch out models. So just another way that we can access a lot of different things and from their perspective. It's very cheap. That's it. You get a lot of compute for the money. So that's definitely one worth playing with if you're into cloudflare products.
Jason Schrader: Next up. We had a new model that dropped so, gotta do at least one of these a week. I feel like but Mistral 70 now has a new version tag, where at the 0.3. So they've done some updates there. been especially in how things are tokenized. That seems to be the big discussion right now is around tokenizers and how those are working, especially in the multi-model state. And last one I thought this was pretty funny. So yesterday was Bitcoin Pizza day. So I thought this was one of the perfect things to share here. So Google AI overview. actually recommended that somebody add glue to keep the cheese on their Pizza
Jason Schrader: and I was looking at why the person founded it was an 11 year old Reddit post where somebody just answered they were being honest. So it was easily picked up something was trained on this. This was an actual response. So really just reminder that training data makes all the difference with the models.
Jason Schrader: and that's all I had for the news if anybody else has anything else now would be the time. Otherwise, we'll move on to the next bit.
Jason Schrader: All So next up just gonna look at some development updates and I close that out a little bit too fast and
Jason Schrader: Yeah, so we have a project board. Let me get to the right one here. That I haven't been making much use of yet, but we can see that one.
00:25:00
Jason Schrader: Not that one on this one. Try not a few different formats. I was either project board where we're starting to collect all the issues and I'm gonna get this updated this week moved over to what's being in progress. I think a few of these have been done just kind of getting things identified and into better places and just to recap from past meetings. What we're doing here is kind of taking every individual thing. We want to become issues that becomes the central place to discuss the individual thing until it is complete also do this the ability to do assignments and a few other items there as Mostly admin type stuff but it's there and we'll probably start using this from meeting to meeting once things have more updated statuses so we can talk about what's in progress and what's going on.
Jason Schrader: All right, and then last bit on our agenda perfect. We're just rounding 9:30 is demo time. So we talked about this last week. We're going to start a segment where we can just show off what's been done either over the last week or if there's a new development or somebody's created something. So Mike for future reference, there's something you wanted to show that you've learned or one of the pieces you're on would love to see that. Also if there's anything that's done around the meeting so Louis if you wanted to demo some of your product process for example, and how you're using AI with the meeting and what it does for you, anything like that is welcome and for today. Gonna hit the main two topics that we talked about last week. So first we have the meeting prep crew which has magically disappeared. Find it again. Here we go.
Jason Schrader: So This Crew is pretty straightforward it just takes a list of links which I've simplified down to be literally just a list of links here's some of the ones that we discussed today and it will run through and look up that link and try to produce the same kind of summary that I am doing in the actual agendas here and it's not a hundred percent there, but we're definitely a lot closer than the week before.
Jason Schrader: Running this one still happens on the command line. But the main changes that happened here is we simplified the agents and the commands that are past tone and same with the scraping tools kind of updated the descriptions and already it seems to be running better. There's still a little bit of issue of being able to pass the output of one task to the next task. So I think that'll be one that we can just kind of tackle next as a small thing to fix and it was supposed to write the final output to a file and it actually wasn't doing that. So we've got that fixed and it updates with a little bit of structure. To it as well. So with that one really like this idea of just outputting it every time and just watching it get better and better so you can see it tried to get the different articles kind of messed up the formatting a little bit here, but it did have some of the topics like there's the AI Gateway here some of what it offers.
Jason Schrader: Here's near with the update that we shared earlier. Google AI suggestion and the actual formatted news came out a little bit better. we're getting close and definitely doing something and we'll just try to get that better, but we still have some template text as well and some other things to fix. So good output there. That was a good process. We're going to keep running that week to week and I'll say probably the coolest thing about it was a lot of what I mentioned initially to it's like working Shadow behind somebody so instead of trying to sit here and put together the news list. I just kept running the crew over and over and making changes and making tweaks and then eventually had to go right the news list myself, but we are way closer to having this thing automated we'll keep making those steps week over week. Hopefully have some bigger updates to share there.
00:30:00
Jason Schrader: Second one is our Bitcoin crew that handles wallet tasks. So when we left off last week, there was an issue with using streamlit and the callbacks which are handled here. And I think we've worked out what the problem is there. They're still an issue with the agent name not being passed but we've opened an issue and create ai's repo for that and then I am getting some repetition in the task output. But those are two minor issues we can kind of work through and then we're now writing the final output to a file as So kind of experimenting with this every time a crew runs. We get a time and date stamp file. That way we can look back and see what was the result and what was the process what did it think along the way? So in this case we had it output the task name and the cast name and the result
Jason Schrader: and I think as far as formatting goes that's something we can fix through prompting but you can see it's actually able to grab information from the wallet and I ran it through all the tasks just to see this would also be good evaluation type stuff to see as well. It's like if we learn run it against different models or when we run it multiple times what ends up being the best result and everything else. So those are all stored just kind of in one main area right now that is sync the three post so people can see the examples down the road. We might have to hide those away or if we get a bunch of submissions or anything else, but I'm not worried about it at this stage and then same goes for the meeting prep is in the agendas. So that'll likely move around a little bit. But you can see the format the idea is just to take everything ai's doing and start dumping it every single time. and last little bit for the
Jason Schrader: Bitcoin crew here. I pull up the actual streamlined deployment. Cool, so just to show that we're getting a little closer here here is simply adding a task to the list in the code. So this is displayed automatically and when we're asking it to do a task, for example, these first three we can come over here and see those are selected and then we can engage our crew.
Jason Schrader: We have a little bit happening in the background. it talks to the API and we start to see the output here down below so you can see that you get whoever speaking which is hard coded right now. We're gonna get that updated you get a little bit about what they're doing and then the information that they provided so this is where except seeing some duplication between the task and the final result. I think it is but it is correctly answering and providing somewhat of a formatted answer here too. So it's like here's the other wallet addresses. There's the
Jason Schrader: and then finally the AI BTC balance. So we've got all that coming in. I didn't notice that this is a little different from before now, but I've been sending faucet transactions all morning. So that's likely why that increased but it'll be interesting to get some checks and balances in there as well. The data itself is pulled from the blockchain so for getting a number here, we can assume it's the correct one and of course we got to account for decimals. So if we go six seven eight is sitting on about two AI BTC total right now and what I'd love to see next week is just giving the crew the ability to send to an address. So, we've got the ability to fund it here. It would just be a function called to do the send should be a really simple ad and then we can get the visual of it tracking that transaction as well a little bit more the information. And that's it. So those are the two agents that we're using right now pretty heavily.
Jason Schrader: Kind of pause there. Did anybody else have anything else that they wanted to demo or show today?
Jason Schrader: All right, and we'll back up any other high level thoughts. I know we covered a lot between the AI news and some of the earlier updates. I'm just gonna leave some space for that if anybody has anything.
Jason Schrader: Thank you again everybody for coming out really appreciate it. I think we've got some really cool things to work toward and definitely looking forward to collaborating with Binaya and Mike anybody else who's definitely want to jump in and Awesome. thank you everyone appreciate the time and I'll look forward to seeing you again next week.
Jason Schrader: 
Patrick Stanley: Thanks gang. Yeah.
mijoco: Right. Thanks Jason. amazing stuff
Jason Schrader: let's just keep building this together.
Rapha RSierra: Thank you, Jason.
Jason Schrader: You raise your hand good.
